To avoid unpredictable loss, the stop-loss and take-profit points are commonly used by investors to handle it. However, they are not easy determined by users when different trading strategies are employed.

A series of computational experiments illustrate how these hybrid approach can include uncertainty into the model, and how this is an essential contribution for informed decision making. A relevant novelty is the inclusion of a sustainability dimension, which allows managers to select and prioritize projects not only based on their monetary profitability but also taking into account the associated environmental and/or social impact.

The dependence between assets is captured through multi-factor linear model. We address this optimization problem using two broad approaches. We show that a suitably scaled asymptotic of the probability of large losses can be developed that is a simple convex function of the allocated resources. Thus, asymptotically, portfolio allocation problem is approximated by a convex programming problem whose solution is easily computed and provides significant managerial insight. We then solve the original problem using sample average simulation optimization. Since rare events are involved, naive simulation may perform poorly. To remedy this, we introduce change-of-variable based importance sampling technique and develop a single change of measure that asymptotically optimally estimates tail probabilities across the entire space of feasible allocations.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-2707-9","10.1109/WSC.2008.4736122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4736122","","Portfolios;Tail;Monte Carlo methods;Loss measurement;Resource management;Optimization methods;Random variables;Discrete event simulation;Computational modeling;Decision making","","","","9","IEEE","30 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our proposed GA based model provides a framework to optimize bank objective when constructing the loan portfolio, which maximize the bank profit and minimize the probability of bank default in a search for an optimal, dynamic lending decision. Multiple factors related to loan characteristics, creditor ratings are integrated to GA chromosomes and validation is performed to ensure the optimal decision. GA uses random search to suggest the best appropriate design. We use this algorithm in order to obtain the most efficient lending decision.

The most important characteristic within this optimization problem is the risk and the returns. Modern portfolio theory provides a well-developed paradigm to form a portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of risk tolerance. Multi objective portfolio optimization problem is the portfolio selection process that result highest expected return and smallest identified risk among the various financial assets. In this paper, we propose to identify expected return (mean profit) and risk using historical data of stock prices. The downside values of the variance of each stock are considered to be the identified risk in first case. The value at risk of each stock that we obtained using parametric and historical simulation methodology are considered to be the identified risk in second case. One of method being widely used lately for optimization need is Genetic Algorithm or GA. This method adapted the mechanism of biology mechanism involving natural selection. With many advantages it has, numerical process of a portfolio optimization in both case are attempted to be coupled with Genetic Algorithm. The values of expected return and risk of each stock will be used as inputs into a fitness function in Genetic Algorithm. Performance evaluation is done by examining the parameters of GA, such as population size, stall generation and number of elitism.","","978-1-4244-5586-7","10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451372","multi objective portfolio optimization;genetic algorithm;fitness function;expected return;risk","Portfolios;Genetic algorithms;Encoding;Optimization methods;Industrial engineering;Genetic mutations;Numerical analysis;MATLAB;Wheels;Constraint optimization","","21","","34","IEEE","19 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is worth investigating the problem of selecting portfolios while considering not only low risk but also high return on investment. The calculation process of the traditional method is highly complex and is not comprehensive in terms of what it takes into consideration. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to calculate portfolio risk. We utilize funds standardization in order to consider the risk of a portfolio and drastically reduce computation complexity. Funds standardization is able to represent fluctuations of investor mood. Moreover, using a Genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the Sharpe Ratio is able to identify the low risk and stable returns of a portfolio. Moreover, over-fitting is a common problem in the stock market, and so this paper uses sliding windows to avoid the over-fitting problem, and tests all kinds of training periods and testing periods that impact on the portfolio. The experimental results show that the proposed method, compared with the traditional method of calculating risk, is able to identify the optimal portfolio and performs efficiently and outstandingly when it comes to this problem.","","978-1-4799-8697-2","10.1109/SMC.2015.498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379630","Portfolio;Sharpe Ratio;Funds Standardization;Genetic algorithm (GA)","Portfolios;Standards;Stock markets;Genetic algorithms;Training;Investment","","10","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The return per unit of risk is the key factor to determine an investment decision and the extended model includes two sets of constraints: bounds on holdings, cardinality. The first set of constraints guarantee that the amount invested (if any) in each asset is between its predetermined upper and lower bounds. The cardinality constraint ensures that the total number of assets selected in the portfolio is equal to a predefined number.

The return per unit of risk is the key factor to determine an investment decision. Secondly, artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) was employed to solve the constructed model. Finally, a real-world case was analyzed to verify the performance of ABC. The result indicated that ABC could generate better solution than GA and it could be regarded as a useful approach for solving real estate portfolio problem.","2155-1855","978-1-4244-8119-4","10.1109/ICMSE.2010.5720009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720009","real estate portfolio;combinatorial optimization;artificial bee colony algorithm;risk preference coefficient;semi-variance","Portfolios;Investments;Optimization;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Iterative methods;Adaptation model","","","","21","IEEE","24 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differing from previous approaches, each component algorithm in our portfolio method has an independent population and the component algorithms do not communicate in any way with each other. Another difference is that our algorithm introduces no control parameters. This parameter-less characteristic is desirable as each additional parameter requires independent parameter tuning or control. A novel score calculation method, based on predicted performance, is used to assess the contributions of component algorithms during the optimization process. Such information is used by an algorithm selector which decides, for each generation, which algorithm to use.

Due to the high complexity and huge amount of data involved in financial applications, the critical task of constructing appropriate machine learning models will surely become more challenging. Typically, data scientists or researchers may employ various optimizers to enhance the feature selection and/or tuning of the involved hyper-parameters in order to improve the overall performance of the obtained learning models. In this paper, a very flexible optimizer, namely the Adaptive Multi-Population optimization Algorithm (AMPOA), utilizing multiple populations with different search strategies is considered in which two of its variants are carefully evaluated with the other state-of-theart optimizers to enhance the feature selection process of the commonly used K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach on a set of 12 well-known benchmark problems. The first variant named the BAMPOA-R approach employs a rounding technique to determine on the binary decision of choosing an input feature or not for the underlying classifier while the other BAMPOA- T approach utilizes a specific transform function to decide on the feature selection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimizer for financial applications, the BAMPOA- R approach with the best performance in the previous test is integrated with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm to compare against other regressors on 10 major financial market indexes. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed AMPOA approach to enhance the prediction performances of the underlying machine learning models through more vigorous feature selection for numerous real-world applications including those challenging problems in computational finance.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407936","binary optimization;feature selection;machine learning;metaheuristic algorithms;stock market prediction","Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Selecting the stocks that simultaneously offer high return and low risk is a difficult problem that is worth investigating. However, the traditional risk calculation based on the modern portfolio theory (MPT) of portfolios has some defects. The MPT method requires the calculations of every relationship between each pair of stocks in the portfolio, entailing high computation complexity, which grows exponentially with the increased number of stocks. Besides, the traditional calculation is unable to calculate the coefficient of variation, and merely considers the relationship between each pair of stocks, so it cannot accurately assess portfolio risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, funds standardization, and utilizes it to represent the portfolio return and calculate portfolio risk. The fluctuation of portfolio funds standardization shows not only the relationships between each pair of stocks, but also the interactions among all stocks. Hence, utilizing funds standardization can accurately assess portfolio risk and completely represent the mood swings of investors. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method significantly reduces the computation complexity because the complexity does not increase when the portfolios stock number increases. We combine the genetic algorithm, Sharpe ratio and funds standardization to find the optimal portfolio. In addition, we utilize the sliding window to avoid the over-fitting problem, which is common in this field, and test the effect of all kinds of training and testing periods. The experimental results show that the portfolio can spread the risk effectively, and that the portfolio risk can be assessed accurately by utilizing the funds standardization. Comparing with the traditional method, our method can identify the optimal portfolio efficiently and establish a portfolio that has lower risk and stable return.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049455","Portfolio;Sharpe ratio;stock selection;funds standardization;low volatility;Genetic algorithm (GA);modern portfolio theory","Portfolios;Standardization;Genetic algorithms;Stock markets;Investment;Neural networks;Timing","","35","","45","OAPA","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because investors always want an approach that can continually provide various portfolios, the issue of group stock portfolio optimization (GSPO) has been raised and the algorithms to obtain a group stock portfolio (GSP) have also been described in the past. A GSP divides the whole set of stocks into several stock groups, and the stocks in a group are exchangeable in investment. Thus, when investors are not satisfied with a suggested stock, they can select another stock from the same group to replace the original one. However, the industry diversity of stocks within a group is not regarded in the existing literatures. In this paper, an algorithm for dealing with the diverse group stock portfolio optimization (DGSPO) is proposed to obtain a diverse group stock portfolio (DGSP). The proposed algorithm is based on the group genetic algorithm with the chromosome representation and the fitness function designed for the purpose of finding a good DGSP. Especially, a factor called group diversity is designed to diversify stocks from different industries and is considered in the fitness evaluation. Another factor considers cash dividend is also applied to keep companies with good quality in the portfolio for increasing the profit of a DGSP.

The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model's robustness. Moreover, to improve the model's computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6 %-7 %, and profit increased by nearly 45 %.

In this paper, a new model with cardinality constraints is first proposed, in which the idiosyncratic volatility factor is used to replace traditional risk measurements and can capture the risks of the portfolio in a more accurate way. The new model has practical constraints which involve the sparsity and irregularity of variables and make it challenging to be solved by traditional Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). To solve the model, a Learning-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm based on Iε+ indicator (Iε+LGEA) is developed. In Iε+LGEA the Iε+ indicator is incorporated into the initialization and genetic operators to guarantee the sparsity of solutions and can help improve the convergence of the algorithm. And a new constraint-handling method based on Iε+ indicator is also adopted to ensure the feasibility of solutions.

However, most existing algorithms are highly specialized to particular formulations and cannot be generalized for broader applications. Therefore, a fast and unified algorithm would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we first introduce a general MVP problem formulation that can fit most existing cases by exploring their commonalities.
