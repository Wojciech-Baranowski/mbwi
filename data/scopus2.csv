By backtesting classical and quantum computing algorithms, we can get a sense of how these algorithms might perform in the real world. This work establishes a methodology for backtesting classical and quantum algorithms in equivalent conditions, and uses it to explore four quantum and three classical computing algorithms for portfolio optimization and compares the results. Running 10 000 experiments on equivalent conditions we find that quantum can match or slightly outperform classical results, showing a better escalability trend. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic backtesting comparison of classical and quantum portfolio optimization algorithms. In this work, we also analyze in more detail the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem, running on simulators and real quantum computers from IBM. The benefits and drawbacks of backtesting are discussed, as well as some of the challenges involved in using real quantum computers of more than 100 qubits. Results show quantum algorithms can be competitive with classical ones, with the advantage of being able to handle a large number of assets in a reasonable time on a future larger quantum computer.  © 2020 IEEE.","Backtesting; conditional value at risk variational quantum eigensolver (CVaR VQE); portfolio optimization; quantum computing (QC); variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)","Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Market Research; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Backtesting; Computational modelling; CVaR VQE; Market researches; Optimisations; Portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; VQE; Optimization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179037821"

Design/methodology/approach: The implemented market risk modeling algorithm and investment portfolio analytics using reinforcement machine learning techniques can simultaneously handle risk-return characteristics of commodity investments under regular and crisis market settings besides considering the particular effects of the time-varying liquidity constraints of the multiple-asset commodity portfolios. Findings: In particular, the paper implements a robust machine learning method to commodity optimal portfolio selection and within a liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk (LVaR) framework. In addition, the paper explains how the adapted LVaR modeling algorithms can be used by a commodity trading unit in a dynamic asset allocation framework for estimating risk exposure, assessing risk reduction alternates and creating efficient and coherent market portfolios. Originality/value: The optimization parameters subject to meaningful operational and financial constraints, investment portfolio analytics and empirical results can have important practical uses and applications for commodity portfolio managers particularly in the wake of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. In addition, the recommended reinforcement machine learning optimization algorithms can aid in solving some real-world dilemmas under stressed and adverse market conditions (e.g. illiquidity, switching in correlations factors signs, nonlinear and non-normal distribution of assets’ returns) and can have key applications in machine learning, expert systems, smart financial functions, internet of things (IoT) and financial technology (FinTech) in big data ecosystems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Business analysis; Commodity; Finance; Liquidity risk; Liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk; Machine learning; Optimization; Portfolio analysis; Portfolio management; Risk analysis; Stress testing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106274228"

The mean variance portfolio optimization aims to minimize variance (risk) and maximize the expected return. In case of linear constraints, the problem can be solved by variants of Markowitz. But many constraints such as cardinality, and transaction cost, make the problem so vital that conventional techniques are not good enough in giving efficient solutions. Stochastic fractal search (SFS) is a strong population based meta-heuristic approach that has derived from evolutionary computation (EC). In this paper, a novel portfolio selection model using SFS based optimization approach has been proposed to maximize Sharpe ratio. SFS is an evolutionary approach. This algorithm models the natural growth process using fractal theory. Performance evaluation has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the model by making comparison with other state of art models such as genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) on same objective and environment. The real datasets of the Bombay stock exchange (BSE) Sensex of Indian stock exchange have been taken in the study.

We also employ a cardinality constraint for limiting the number of invested assets. Solving such a cardinality-constrained mean-CVaR model is computationally challenging for two main reasons. First, this model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problem because of the cardinality constraint, so solving it exactly is very hard when the number of investable assets is large. Second, the problem size depends on the number of asset return scenarios, and the computational efficiency decreases when the number of scenarios is large. To overcome these challenges, we propose a high-performance algorithm named the bilevel cutting-plane algorithm for exactly solving the cardinality-constrained mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problem. We begin by reformulating the problem as a bilevel optimization problem and then develop a cutting-plane algorithm for solving the upper-level problem. To speed up computations for cut generation, we apply to the lower-level problem another cutting-plane algorithm for efficiently minimizing CVaR with a large number of scenarios. Moreover, we prove the convergence properties of our bilevel cutting-plane algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with other MIO approaches, our algorithm can provide optimal solutions to large problem instances faster. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardinality constraint; Conditional value-at-risk; Cutting-plane algorithm; Mixed-integer optimization; Portfolio optimization","Computational efficiency; Financial data processing; Integer programming; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Bilevel optimization problems; Cardinality constraints; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Convergence properties; Cutting plane algorithms; High performance algorithms; Mixed integer optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Constrained optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109778732"

By considering the uncertainty of the parameters, the goal is to construct a sparse portfolio with low volatility and decent returns, subject to other investment constraints. In this paper, we propose a new portfolio selection model, which considers the perturbation in the asset return matrix and the parameter uncertainty in the expected asset return. We define three types of stationary points of the penalty problem: the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point, the strong Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point, and the partial minimizer. We analyze the relationship between these stationary points and the local/global minimizer of the penalty model under mild conditions. We design a penalty alternating-direction method to obtain the solutions.

In this stochastic composite optimization, the inner mapping can be expressed as an expectation over random component mappings. In this study, we propose two algorithms to address the generality and possible singularities of this problem and bound their sample complexities for finding an ϵ-stationary point. The first algorithm is the prox-linear hybrid stochastic gradient algorithm, which may achieve sample complexities of O(ϵ2τ−5/2) and O(ϵτ−3/2) for the component mappings and their Jacobians respectively, where τ∈[0,1]. The second algorithm is the normalized proximal hybrid stochastic gradient algorithm, which takes advantage of the special structure of the regularizer. This algorithm may achieve sample complexities of O(ϵ2τ−4) for both the component mappings and the Jacobians, where τ∈[5/4,7/4].

This study considers it to be a hybrid of a classical feature selection problem and a standard mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection model. In particular, we propose a new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm that combines an enhanced binary honey badger algorithm (EBHBA) with quadratic programming to address this issue. First, we employ the proposed EBHBA algorithm to select a portfolio of K stocks from N candidate stocks. Second, based on its choice we transform the problem into a mean-variance model, whose objective function could be defined as the fitness function of EBHBA. Finally, the optimal solution to the model could be found with the quadratic programming method. We also test our approach using the benchmark data sets available at the OR-Library involving real capital markets, where indices are derived from major stock markets around the world. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory result for portfolio selection with cardinality constraints and perform well in searching non-dominated portfolios with high expected returns. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","binary honey badger algorithm; cardinality constrained portfolio selection; Metaheuristics; portfolio optimization; quadratic programming","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138027095"

One of the most widely studied portfolio optimization models is the cardinality constrained mean–variance model, which incorporates real-world constraints on the number of selected assets and lower and upper bounds on the proportion of each asset. This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on the Mayfly algorithm to solve the cardinality constrained mean–variance portfolio optimization problem. To better adapt to this problem, we design and introduce some new features to the proposed algorithm, including (1) a new cardinality constraint handling strategy; (2) a new local search strategy; and (3) changes to the crossover operator. We have designed comparison experiments for the proposed metaheuristic and evaluated its performance using five commonly used performance metrics.

For instance, time-series for daily stock data would be profiled at 252 points in one year. However, this episodic style neglects the important events, or price changes that occur between two intervals. Thus, we use Directional Changes (DC) as an event-based series, which is an alternative way to record price movements. In DC, unlike time-series methods, time intervals are constituted by price changes. The unique feature that decides the price change to be considered as a significant is called a threshold θ. The objective of our paper is to create DC-based trading strategies, and then optimize them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). To construct such strategies, we use DC-based indicators and scaling laws that have been empirically identified under DC summaries. We first propose four novel DC-based trading strategies and then combine them with existing DC-based strategies and finally optimize them via the GA. We conduct trading experiments over 44 stocks. Results show that the GA-optimized strategies are able to generate new and profitable trading strategies, significantly outperforming the individual DC-based strategies, as well as a buy and sell benchmark.  © 2022 IEEE.","directional changes; financial forecasting; genetic algorithm; machine learning; trading strategies","Commerce; Electronic trading; Machine learning; Time series; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Fixed time interval; Machine-learning; Physical time; Price changes; Stock data; Strategy optimization; Times series; Trading strategies; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138678479"

In this paper, we propose a new three-objective Sortino ratio-expected shortfall-turnover rate (SR-ES-TR) portfolio optimization (PO) model. The Sortino ratio is used to measure the risk-adjusted rate of return. The expected shortfall is used to measure the tail risk of a portfolio.

In this work, we advocate using the Parallel Algorithm Portfolio (PAP), which runs multiple MOEAs independently in parallel and gets the best out of them, to combine the advantages of different MOEAs. Since the manual construction of PAPs is non-trivial and tedious, we propose to automatically construct high-performance PAPs for solving MOPs. Specifically, we first propose a variant of PAPs, namely MOEAs/PAP, which can better determine the output solution set for MOPs than conventional PAPs. Then, we present an automatic construction approach for MOEAs/PAP with a novel performance metric for evaluating the performance of MOEAs across multiple MOPs. Finally, we use the proposed approach to construct an MOEAs/PAP based on a training set of MOPs and an algorithm configuration space defined by several variants of NSGA-II.

More specifically, the view vector is generated based on the predicted asset returns obtained by random forests, and the confidence matrix which contains the uncertainty of each view is measured by the difference in the predicted values of multiple trees. Furthermore, motivated by decomposition strategy, a novel multi-objective DIRECT algorithm is introduced to effectively resolve the proposed model. Through the construction of a unique indicator, the algorithm possesses the capacity to select potentially-optimal hyperrectangles in all reference directions simultaneously, which will further improve the exploratory nature. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance over NSGA-II and MOEA/D on the MOP and DTLZ benchmark problems. It is also experimentally verified that the random forest-based Black–Litterman model can obtain higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios in the application of Chinese stock markets when compared to the classic MV model. © 2022 by the authors.","Black–Litterman model; DIRECT; multi-objective optimization; portfolio selection; random forests","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137351441"

According to the purpose, the research was of the applied type, in terms of data, quantitative and postevent, and in terms of the type of analysis, it was of the descriptive-correlation type. Sequence, skewness and kurtosis tests were used to identify the months with bubbles from 2015 to 2021 in the Tehran Stock Exchange. After identifying the bubble courses, artificial bee colony meta-heuristic and invasive weed algorithms were used to optimize the portfolio. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The existence of bubbles in the market, especially in the capital market, can prevent the participation of investors in the capital market process and the correct allocation of financial resources for the economic development of the country. However, due to the goal of investors to achieve a portfolio of high returns with the least amount of risk, there is need to pay attention to these markets increases. Findings: The results identify 14 periods of price bubbles during the study period. Additionally, stock portfolios with maximum returns and minimum risk were selected for portfolio optimization. According to the results of using meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize the portfolio, in relation to the obtained returns and risk, no significant difference was observed between the returns and risk of periods with price bubbles in each of the two meta-heuristic algorithms. This study can guide investors in identifying bubble courses and forming an optimal portfolio under these conditions. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this research is the non-generalizability of the findings to stock exchanges of other countries and other time periods due to the condition of the price bubble, as well as other companies in the stock market due to the restrictions considered for selecting the statistical sample.

For investors, return and risk often coexist. How to rationally allocate funds into different assets and achieve excess returns with effectively controlling risk are main problems to be solved in the field of portfolio optimization (PO). At present, due to the influence of modeling and algorithm solving, the PO models established by many researchers are still mainly focused on single-stage single-objective models or single-stage multi-objective models. PO is actually considered as a multi-stage multi-objective optimization problem in real investment scenarios. It is more difficult than the previous single-stage PO model for meeting the realistic requirements. In this paper, the authors proposed a mean-improved stable tail adjusted return ratio-maximum drawdown rate (M-ISTARR-MD) PO model which effectively characterizes the real investment scenario. In order to solve the multi-stage multi-objective PO model with complex multi-constraints, the authors designed a multi-stage constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with orthogonal learning (MSCMOEA-OL). Comparing with four well-known intelligence algorithms, the MSCMOEA-OL algorithm has competitive advantages in solving the M-ISTARR-MD model on the proposed constructed carbon neutral stock dataset.

From financial institutions to individual investors, foreign exchange asset allocation has become important contents worthy of attention. However, most intelligent optimization algorithms (hereinafter IOAS) adopt the existing data and ignore the forecasted one in the foreign exchange portfolio allocation, which will result in a huge difference between portfolio allocation and actual demand; at the same time, many IOAS are less adaptable and have lower optimization ability in portfolio problems. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper first proposed a DETS based on hybrid tabu search and differential evolution algorithms (DEAs), which has excellent optimization ability. Subsequently, the DETS algorithm was applied to support vector machine (SVM) model. Experiments show that, compared with other algorithms, the MAE and RMSE obtained by using DETS optimization parameters are reduced by at least 3.79 and 1.47%, while the CTR is improved by at least 2.19%. Then combined with the DETS algorithm and Pareto sorting theory, an algorithm suitable for multi-objective optimization was further proposed, named NSDE-TS. Finally, by applying NSDE-TS algorithm, the optimal foreign exchange portfolio is acquired. The empirical analysis shows that the Pareto front obtained by this algorithm is better than that of NSGA-II. Since the lower the uniformity index and convergence index, the stronger the optimization performance of the corresponding algorithm, compared with NSGA-II, its uniformity and convergence index decreased by 15.7 and 39.6%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Differential evolution algorithm; Exchange rate forecast; Foreign exchange portfolio; Pareto principle; Tabu search algorithm","COVID-19; Electronic trading; Evolutionary algorithms; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Support vector machines; Tabu search; Convergence indices; Differential evolution algorithms; Exchange rate forecast; Exchange rates; Foreign exchange; Foreign exchange portfolio; NSGA-II; Optimization ability; Tabu search algorithms; Uniformity index; Pareto principle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141372145"

However, most of the existing MOEAs do not consider the preferences of decision-makers. Meanwhile, there are certain limitations to the traditional crossover and mutation strategy in the exploration of population diversity. To overcome these disadvantages, this paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on piecewise parallel decomposition (MOEA-PPD). The algorithm takes the largest Sharpe ratio as the piecewise marker of parallel decomposition for portfolio optimization problems. In addition, a neuro-evolution strategy is applied to better approximate a global non-dominated front in the early stage. Then a crossover and mutation strategy is used to enhance the convergence of the obtained non-dominated front in the later stage. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive in terms of diversity and convergence for portfolio optimization. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Neuro-evolution; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratio","Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Financial data processing; Crossover and mutation; Crossover strategies; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Mutation strategy; Neuro evolutions; Optimization problems; Piece-wise; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratios; Multiobjective optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136336885"

In the past few years, portfolio optimization has appeared as a demanding and fascinating multi-objective problem, in the area of computational finance. Yet, it is accepting the growing attention of fund management companies, researchers and individual investors. The primary issues in portfolio selection are the choice of a subset of assets and its related optimal weights of every chosen asset. The composition of every asset is chosen in a manner such that the total profit or return of the portfolio is improved thereby reducing the risk at the same time. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a novel portfolio asset prediction using the modified deep learning concept. For implementing this framework, a set of data involving the portfolio details of different companies for certain duration is selected. The proposed model involves two main phases. One is to predict the future state or profit of every company, and the other is to select the company which is giving maximum profit in the future. In the first phase, a deep learning model called recurrent neural network (RNN) is used for predicting the future condition of the entire companies taken in the data set and thus creates the data library. Once the forecasting of the data is done, the selection of companies for the portfolio is done using a hybrid optimization algorithm by integrating Jaya algorithm (JA) and spotted hyena optimization (SHO) termed as Jaya-based spotted hyena optimization (J-SHO). This optimization model tries to get the optimal solution including which company has to be selected, and optimized RNN helps to predict the future return while using those companies. The main objective model of the J-SHO-based RNN is to maximize the prediction accuracy and J-SHO-based portfolio asset selection is to maximize the profit. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets from real-world stock markets with diverse assets in various time periods shows that the developed model outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies proving its efficiency in portfolio optimization. Findings: From the analysis, the profit analysis of proposed J-SHO for predicting after 7 days in next month was 46.15% better than particle swarm optimization (PSO), 18.75% better than grey wolf optimization (GWO), 35.71% better than whale optimization algorithm (WOA), 5.56% superior to JA and 35.71% superior to SHO. Therefore, it can be certified that the proposed J-SHO was effective in providing intelligent portfolio asset selection and prediction when compared with the conventional methods. Originality/value: This paper presents a technique for providing a novel portfolio asset prediction using J-SHO algorithm.

Selecting the portfolio is a non-trivial task that requires balancing the trade-off between the higher flexibility of large portfolios with the increased complexity of the AAS task. In practice, probably the most common way to choose the algorithms for the portfolio is a greedy selection of the algorithms that perform well in some reference tasks of interest. We set out in this work to investigate alternative, data-driven portfolio selection techniques. Our proposed method creates algorithm behavior meta-representations, constructs a graph from a set of algorithms based on their meta-representation similarity, and applies a graph algorithm to select a final portfolio of diverse, representative, and non-redundant algorithms. We evaluate two distinct meta-representation techniques (SHAP and performance2vec) for selecting complementary portfolios from a total of 324 different variants of CMA-ES for the task of optimizing the BBOB single-objective problems in dimensionalities 5 and 30 with different cut-off budgets. We test two types of portfolios: one related to overall algorithm behavior and the 'personalized' one (related to algorithm behavior per each problem separately). We observe that the approach built on the performance2vec-based representations favors small portfolios with negligible error in the AAS task, whereas the portfolios built from the SHAP-based representations gain from higher flexibility at the cost of decreased performance of the AAS. Across most considered scenarios, personalized portfolios yield comparable or slightly better performance than the classical greedy approach. They outperform the full portfolio in all scenarios.  ©2023 the authors.","","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Algorithm selection; Automated algorithms; Black-box optimization; Data driven; Greedy selections; High flexibility; Non-trivial tasks; Performance; Portfolio selection; Trade off; Optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184348669"

Portfolio optimization is a way to maximize net gains in a portfolio while minimizing risk. A portfolio means investing in a wide variety of asset types and classes for a risk-mitigation strategy by the investor. In this paper, factor analysis and cluster algorithm are used to screen stocks and an improved differential evolution algorithm for solving portfolio optimization model is proposed. By comprehensively analyzing the stock data with factor analysis and k-means clustering algorithm, it has found that important factors have important effect on stock price movement, and finally 10 stocks are selected with investment value. Besides, a Mean-Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) model is constructed, which takes into account both the cost function and the diversification constraint. Finally, a second-order memetic differential evolution (SOMDE) algorithm is presented for solving the proposed model. The experiments show that the proposed SOMDE algorithm is valid for solving the Mean-CVaR model and that factor analysis for stock selection can benefit portfolio with higher return and less risk greatly. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Differential evolution algorithm; Factor analysis; Mean-CVaR model; Memetic algorithm; Portfolio optimization","Cost functions; Evolutionary algorithms; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; K-means clustering; Multivariant analysis; Optimization; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Differential evolution algorithms; Factors analysis; Mean-conditional value at risk model; Memetic; Memetic algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Risk mitigation strategy; Risk modeling; Second orders; Factor analysis","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185136439"

This aspect was formulated by modern portfolio theory as a quadratic optimisation problem of optimising expected returns and reducing portfolio risk. The model proposed by Markowitz is a perfect example of a multi-objective optimisation problem, in which the aim is to find the best trade-off solutions. Here, the trade-offs are between the portfolio return and its variance. In this paper, the multi-objective version of the unconstrained portfolio optimisation problem is presented. Henceforth, it is proved that there is no difference in the solutions obtained by solving the unconstrained multi-objective portfolio optimisation problem and the single-objective weighted sum approach of the unconstrained portfolio optimisation problem. A genetic algorithm is then suggested to solve the unconstrained problem of portfolio optimisation. Genetic algorithm is used on four existing data sets in the literature to find the efficient frontiers. The obtained unconstrained efficient frontiers are analysed using six different performance metrics in comparison with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Evolutionary algorithm; Evolutionary computation; Genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimisation; Portfolio optimization","Computation theory; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electronic trading; Multiobjective optimization; Quadratic programming; Decisions makings; Efficient frontier; Expected return; Financial decisions; Modern portfolio theories; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio risks; Quadratic optimization problems; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150986095"

The most important and common problems are combinatorial optimization problems in finance, such as common stock investment, financial management, etc. Among such problems, linear system solving problems are of this type. The core of the problem. Now with the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, it has been well applied in the financial industry, but with the advent of the era of big data, massive amounts of data have brought huge challenges to the solution of classic solving methods and computing resources. Lloyd et al. proposed an HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Under some assumptions, this algorithm can solve linear equations with exponential acceleration compared to classical algorithms. It is a key step in current quantum machine learning algorithms. More classic algorithms can achieve exponential acceleration. In this paper, the use of HHL algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems in finance has been researched and tested. The problem is described as a quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the corresponding program design is carried out, verified and the final system state is carried out. The results are measured, and the results are analyzed. It is found that compared with the classical solution method, the HHL algorithm can be used to solve such combinatorial optimization problems, and the approximate solution obtained is in good agreement with the exact solution, which can be applied well. The solution process of such combinatorial optimization problems can be accelerated, and quantum computing can be better applied to such problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","HHL; Portfolio optimization; Quadratic programming; Quantum machine learning","Combinatorial optimization; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Linear systems; Support vector machines; Combinatorial optimization problems; Exponentials; Financial managements; Financial problems; HHL; Machine-learning; Mathematical problems; Portfolio optimization; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quadratic programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135047041"

Investing in stocks can give passive income to help people deal with the increasing prices of necessities. However, selecting stocks and constructing a portfolio is the major problem in investing. This research will illustrate the stock selection method and the optimization method for optimizing the portfolio. Stock selection is carried out by clustering using Self-organizing Maps (SOM). Clustering will show the best stocks formed for a portfolio to be optimized. The best stocks that have the best performance are selected from each cluster for the portfolio. The best performance of the stock can be determined using the Sharpe Ratio. Optimization will be carried out using a Genetic Algorithm. The optimization is carried out using software R i386 3.6.1. The optimization results are then compared to the Markowitz Theory to show which method is better. The expected return on the portfolio generated using Genetic Algorithm and Markowitz Theory are 3.348458 and 3.347559975, respectively. While, the value of the Sharpe Ratio is 0.1393076 and 0.13929785, respectively. Based on the results, the best performance of the portfolio is the portfolio produced using Genetic Algorithm with the greater value of the Sharpe Ratio. Furthermore, the Genetics Algorithm optimization is more optimal than the Markowitz Theory. © 2022, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

We aim to extend the classical mean-variance formulation by maximizing a modified version of the Sharpe ratio subject to cardinality, box, and budget constraints. The algorithm involves a projection operator to deal with these three constraints simultaneously. Further, we implicitly control transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint handled by a suitable exact penalty function. In addition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars in the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three large-scale data sets, show that including this procedure improves the accuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO algorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding performance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and solution quality.

The Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm and sample entropy (SE), combined with LSTM, are used to construct the integrated prediction model, which has dramatically improved the forecast precision. On the premise of accurate prediction, the extreme value theory (EVT) is introduced to improve the predictive ability of dynamic value at risk (VaR), which can manage the risk of portfolio. To forecast stock trends, the approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to assign weights to related factors. The final trading decisions are made by establishing trading signals and scoring models.

At present, decision tree algorithm is the most commonly used method in data mining classification technology because of its high classification accuracy, fast speed and easy understanding of classification rules. The most fundamental purpose of securities investment is to gain benefits. However, in investment activities, returns are always accompanied by risks. Generally, the higher the income, the greater the risk. In order to diversify risks, investors combine many kinds of securities to invest, the so-called investment portfolio, in order to obtain the maximum return. This makes the research of investment portfolio one of the major issues in the financial world.  © 2021 ACM.","Decision tree algorithm; Minimax model; Securities portfolio","Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Information management; Optimization; Data analysis tool; Decision-tree algorithm; Investments portfolios; Large amounts of data; Minimax; Minimax model; Model and algorithms; Network database; Optimization algorithms; Portfolio optimization models; Investments","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126230186"

This may be understood as an alternative approach to risk reduction in a portfolio based on a new mathematical quantity. First, we apply recently introduced semi-metrics between finite sets to determine the distance between time series’ structural breaks. Then, we build on the classical portfolio optimization theory of Markowitz and use this distance between asset structural breaks for our penalty function, rather than portfolio variance. Our experiments are promising: on synthetic data, we show that our proposed method does indeed diversify among time series with highly similar structural breaks and enjoys advantages over existing metrics between sets. On real data, experiments illustrate that our proposed optimization method performs well relative to nine other commonly used options, producing the second-highest returns, the lowest volatility, and second-lowest drawdown. The main implication for this method in portfolio management is reducing simultaneous asset shocks and potentially sharp associated drawdowns during periods of highly similar structural breaks, such as a market crisis. Our method adds to a considerable literature of portfolio optimization techniques in econometrics and could complement these via portfolio averaging. © 2023 by the authors.","change point detection; market crises; nonlinear dynamics; portfolio optimization; time series analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150985155"

As a consequence, a variety of methods and techniques have been developed, spanning from purely mathematics ones to computational intelligence ones. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimal portfolio selection based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, specifically Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), which tries to maximize the yield and minimize the risk, simultaneously. The system, named EvoFolio, has been experimented on stock datasets in a three-years time-frame and varying the configurations/specifics of NSGA-II operators. EvoFolio is an interactive genetic algorithm, i.e., users can provide their own insights and suggestions to the algorithm such that it takes into account users’ preferences for some stocks. We have performed tests with optimizations occurring quarterly and monthly. The results show how EvoFolio can significantly reduce the risk of portfolios consisting only of stocks and obtain very high performance (in terms of return). Furthermore, considering the investor’s preferences has proved to be very effective in the portfolio’s composition and made it more attractive for end-users. We argue that EvoFolio can be effectively used by investors as a support tool for portfolio formation. © The Author(s) 2024.","62M45; 68T05; 68T07; 93C42; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Realistic genetic operator; Stock market","Electronic trading; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; 62m45; 68t05; 68t07; 93c42; Genetic operators; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Optimal portfolio selection; Portfolio optimization; Realistic genetic operator; Financial markets","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185252431"

Stock evaluation and portfolio optimization have a decision-making process that contains tangible and intangible factors under vague parameters. This study presents an integrated approach including the fuzzy MULTIMOORA based on Correlation Coefficient and Standard Deviation (CCSD) method and the mean–variance-ranking cardinality constrained portfolio optimization (MVRCCPO), which is the extension of classical mean-variance cardinality constrained portfolio optimization model. The ranking obtained from the fuzzy MULTIMOORA based on the CCSD method is handled as one of the objective functions in the proposed model. The MVRCCPO problem is an NP-Complete problem when taking cardinality constraints into account. In this case, existing exact algorithms such as quadratic programming may not be efficient for solving the problem. Due to the complexity of the problem and the nature of the multiple objectives, we used the multi-objective genetic algorithm based on three different scalarization techniques, involving conic, tchebycheff, and weighted-sum. The performance of the multi-objective genetic algorithm with scalarization variants is investigated across forty-nine benchmark instances consisting of seven different objective weight combinations and seven different instances from ‘small’ to ‘large’ size derived from a large real-life problem. The computational results indicate that the multi-objective genetic algorithm utilizing weighted-sum in accordance with the weighted distance to the ideal point outperforms the rest in point of the obtained results in most cases. Moreover, the multi-objective genetic algorithm using conic in accordance with the weighted distance to the reference point is better performance than the multi-objective genetic algorithm using tchebycheff. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardinality constraints; Fuzzy MULTIMOORA; Markowitz mean-variance model; Portfolio optimization; Scalarization methods","Benchmarking; Computational complexity; Constrained optimization; Decision making; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Cardinalities; Cardinality constraints; Constrained portfolios; Fuzzy MULTIMOORA; Markowitz; Markowitz mean-variance model; Mean variance model; Multi-objectives genetic algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Scalarization method; Quadratic programming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141168960"

However, the advancement of hardware, the considerable improvement in computer processing speed, the learning ability, and the efficiency of machine learning have led to fast growth surpassing human ability in many fields.

In most existing methods, portfolios are re-optimized, hence re-balanced, at pre-specified time periods, return properties of each asset are dynamically computed, and portfolio weights are optimized according to an objective function. We propose a novel algorithm for dynamic portfolio optimization with a two-step signaling mechanism for re-balancing the portfolio including the optimization of re-balancing points and portfolio weights. The first step signals portfolio re-balancing only if there is a substantial price change in one or more of the portfolio constituents. These substantial price changes are defined according to directional change (DC) methods. DC methods create an intrinsic time series for each asset according to whether or not the change in the asset price exceeds a threshold level, hence removing part of the noise in asset prices. The second signaling mechanism uses genetic algorithms (GA) to assess if re-balancing is indeed profitable at each point indicated by the first signaling mechanism. The genetic algorithm is set up such that it simultaneously optimizes the weights of the re-balanced portfolio. For GA, we input the asset price summaries retrieved from DC methods to ensure that the GA can learn from the relatively less noisy data compared to observed asset prices. We show that the GA fit function can be set up to include several conventional trading strategies. As a first step, we apply the proposed method to a portfolio of 30 assets including 29 Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and one risk-free asset where daily prices are observed during the period between 2 January 2018 and 30 December 2021. Second, we apply the method to 100 individual stocks for the same time period. We compare the obtained portfolio results with benchmarks, such as the simple buy and hold strategy of the S&P 500 index, the naive 1/N portfolio, and a minimum variance portfolio in terms of standard portfolio evaluation methods including the Sharpe ratio. © 2023 IEEE.","Directional changes; financial portfolio optimization; genetic algorithms","Commerce; Costs; Dynamics; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Asset prices; Directional changes; Dynamic portfolios; Financial portfolio; Financial portfolio optimization; Optimisations; Portfolio optimization; Price changes; Signalling mechanisms; Time-periods; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174493004"

This paper proposes a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on multi-population, called MP-MOEA, to handle the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problem (MOCPOP) in order to achieve an optimal trade-off between return and risk. MP-MOEA uses a multi-population strategy to improve the solution’s quality and considerably accelerate the convergence. Furthermore, two types of archives (local and global) are employed, where the archives local are used to store the non-dominated solutions corresponding to each subpopulation, and the external archive global is used to store the Pareto solutions. The external archive global is controlled using crowding distance to limit the archive size and avoid increasing the complexity of the MP-MOEA algorithm. Several experiments are conducted on two datasets of instances to compare our algorithm with three elevant state-of-art algorithms including AR-MOEA, MOEA/D-AGR, MOEA/D-GR, MOEA/D, MODEwAwL, and MOPSO.

Portfolio optimization (PO) is becoming more and more important for investors. However, PO is frequently a kind of NP-hard problem in the field of modern financial optimization, which has gradually attracted the attention and interest of researchers. Some efficient mathematical models were built to describe the return and risk of portfolio. A lot of precise and approximate fast algorithms are used to solve the established PO models. The fundamental purpose is to maximize the return and to minimize the risk of portfolio under certain constraints. In recent years, researchers not only limit the goal of PO to the balance between risk and return, but also pay attention to liquidity, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) controversy level, Sortino ratio, and other indicators. The number of PO targets and constraints is further extended. In the past two decades, swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms have been widely introduced to solve PO problems. SI algorithm is mainly inspired from the daily phenomena in nature or self-organization, self-adaptation, and self-learning of biological population. The existing research results show that SI algorithm has the characteristics of high efficiency and can obtain satisfactory solutions in solving PO problems. The recent advances on the classic portfolio optimization concepts, models, and the usual SI-based solving algorithms are presented. Finally, future potential research directions are presented. © 2022 Yinnan Chen et al.","","Bioinformatics; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Optimization; Fast algorithms; Financial optimizations; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Self organizations; Self-adaptation learning; Self-learning; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Uncertainty; Swarm intelligence","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134888716"

The key component of the algorithm is the definition and solution of an appropriate portfolio problem. For the last one, the disbursements for the business management are regarded as potential portfolio resources. For the portfolio definition, the increases or decreases of the disbursements are assumed to be the assets, whose weights are found as solutions from the portfolio optimization problem. These solutions recommend the reallocation of the resources between different disbursements, which increases the income of the business entity. The definition and solution of this portfolio problem are made sequentially in time, and the obtained solutions are applied as recommendations for future business management steps. An algorithm for business management, based on the sliding mode of repetitive definitions and solutions of portfolio problems with historical data of last disbursements, gives recommendations for the reallocation of resources for the next future period of management. The algorithm is numerically tested with real data on animal husbandry from Bulgaria. The empirical results demonstrate an advantage in increasing the husbandry income in comparison with the lack of such an active business policy.

It seeks for the optimal combination of products and attribute levels offered for customers in the target market, which is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, a Probability-based Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PDPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the PPP problem. In PDPSO, the particle is encoded as discrete values, which can be straightforwardly used to represent the product portfolio with discrete attributes. PDPSO adopts a probability-based mechanism to update particles. Specifically, a probability vector is used to decide the probability of three search behaviors, i.e., learning from the personal best position, global best position, or random search. In experiments, the search performance of PDPSO has been compared with that of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm on generated PPP problem cases with different sizes. The results indicate that PDPSO obtains significantly better optimization results than GA and SA in most cases and obtains desirable/near-optimal solutions on various PPP problem cases. A case study of notebook computer portfolio planning is also presented to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PDPSO. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Combinational optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Probability-based solution updating mechanism; Product portfolio planning; Solution repairing strategy","Combinatorial optimization; Commerce; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Combinational optimization; Discrete particle swarm optimization; Discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Planning problem; Probability-based solution updating mechanism; Product portfolio planning; Solution repairing strategy; Swarm optimization; Simulated annealing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160847782"

Through a comprehensive analysis of stock data using principal component analysis and the k-means clustering algorithm, it was discovered that certain factors have a significant impact on stock price movement. Subsequently, 10 stocks with investment value were selected. Additionally, a Mean-Value at Risk (VaR) model is constructed, considering both the cost function and the diversification constraint.

Design/methodology/approach: The author implements a robust methodology to assess regulatory economic-capital allocation in a liquidity-adjusted value at risk (LVaR) context, mostly from the standpoint of investable portfolios analytics that have long- and short-sales asset allocation or for those portfolios that contain long-only asset allocation. The optimization route is accomplished by controlling the nonlinear quadratic objective risk function with certain regulatory constraints along with LVaR-GARCH-M (1,1) procedure to forecast conditional risk parameters and expected returns for multiple asset classes. Findings: The author’s conclusions emphasize that the attained investable economic-capital portfolios lie-off the efficient frontier, yet those long-only portfolios seem to lie near the efficient frontier than portfolios with long- and short-sales assets allocation. In effect, the newly observed market microstructures forms and derived deductions were not apparent in prior research studies (Al Janabi, 2013). Practical implications: The attained empirical results are quite interesting for practical portfolio optimization, within the environments of big data analytics, reinforcement machine learning, expert systems and smart financial applications. Furthermore, it is quite promising for multiple-asset portfolio management techniques, performance measurement and improvement analytics, reinforcement machine learning and operations research algorithms in financial institutions operations, above all after the consequences of the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Originality/value: While this paper builds on Al Janabi’s (2013) optimization algorithms and modeling techniques, it varies in the sense that it covers the outcomes of a multi-asset portfolio optimization method under severe event market scenarios and by allowing for both long-only and combinations of long-/short-sales multiple asset. The achieved empirical results, optimization parameters and efficient and investable economic-capital figures were not apparent in Al Janabi’s (2013) paper because the prior evaluation were performed under normal market circumstances and without bearing in mind the impacts of the 2007–2009 global financial crunch. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial crisis; Financial engineering; Liquidity-adjusted value at risk; Optimization algorithms; Portfolio management analytics; Reinforcement machine-learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126048491"

Traditionally, evolutionary algorithms are used to solve this problem; however, they do not exploit the locality structure of a solution or compute the values of its objective functions using the full set of n decision variables. As a result, the number of evaluations that can be computed within a fixed amount of time decreases as the size of the instances increases, yielding poor performance. This work proposes a new non-evolutionary GRASP/Δ algorithm that includes a novel local search with an efficient local computation strategy. The use of local computation reduces the number of operations required to compute the values of the objective functions from O(n) to O(1). Consequently, the increment in evaluations performed in the proposed approach increases the quality of the obtained solutions, particularly as the search space grows. An experiment conducted with instances of different sizes demonstrates the overall competitiveness of GRASP/Δ compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results show, as expected, that the differences in performance become statistically more significant when dealing with instances defined by large search spaces. These results were validated using non-parametric statistical tests. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","GRASP algorithm; Local computation algorithm; Multi-objective portfolio optimization problem; Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers; Uncertainty","Computational efficiency; Financial data processing; Function evaluation; Fuzzy sets; Multiobjective optimization; Quality control; Computation algorithm; GRASP algorithm; Local computation; Local computation algorithm; Multi-objective portfolio optimization; Multi-objective portfolio optimization problem; Objective functions; Optimization problems; Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers; Uncertainty; Evolutionary algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136663312"

Portfolios on the EF may contain many assets, making their management difficult and possibly expensive. An investor may wish to impose an upper bound on the number of assets in their portfolio, leading to so-called cardinality constrained efficient frontiers (CCEFs). Recently, a new algorithm was developed to find CCEFs for small cardinalities. Relative to other algorithms for this problem, this algorithm is very intuitive, and its authors demonstrated that it performs at nearly the state-of-the-art. However, we have found that the algorithm seems to struggle in certain situations, particularly when faced with both bonds and equities. While preserving its intuitiveness, we modified the algorithm to improve its CCEFs. This improvement comes with longer runtimes, but we think many practitioners will prefer the algorithm with modifications. Some practitioners may prefer other algorithms, due to the runtimes or because some points on our CCEFs still fall short of optimality. However, in addition to its intuitiveness, our modified algorithms (and the original version) find low-risk points on the CCEF that a state-of-the-art algorithm does not. © 2023 The Author(s).

Efficient portfolios that provide optimal trade-offs between mean and variance warrant consideration. To express a preference among these efficient portfolios, investors have put forward many mean-variance portfolio (MVP) formulations which date back to the classical Markowitz portfolio. However, most existing algorithms are highly specialized to particular formulations and cannot be generalized for broader applications. Therefore, a fast and unified algorithm would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we first introduce a general MVP problem formulation that can fit most existing cases by exploring their commonalities. Then, we propose a widely applicable and provably convergent successive quadratic programming algorithm (SCQP) for the general formulation. The proposed algorithm can be implemented based on only the QP solvers and thus is computationally efficient. In addition, a fast implementation is considered to accelerate the algorithm. The numerical results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of convergence speed and scalability. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","active set methods; Mean-variance portfolios; Pareto frontier; successive quadratic programming algorithm","Approximation algorithms; Economic and social effects; Financial data processing; Quadratic programming; Risk assessment; Signal processing; Active-set methods; Efficient portfolio; Linear-programming; Mean-variance portfolios; Optical wavelength conversion; Optimisations; Pareto frontiers; Portfolio; Signal processing algorithms; Successive Quadratic Programming algorithms; Linear programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165245166"

As the pool of investable assets grows, and additional constraints are imposed, the problem becomes NP-hard. Thus, metaheuristics are commonly employed for solving large instances of rich versions. However, metaheuristics do not fully account for random returns and noisy covariances, which renders them unrealistic in the presence of heightened uncertainty in financial markets. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a simulation–optimization approach – specifically, a simheuristic algorithm that integrates a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic with Monte Carlo simulation – to deal with stochastic returns and noisy covariances modeled as random variables. Computational experiments performed on a well-established benchmark instance illustrate the advantages of our methodology and analyze how the solutions change in response to a varying degree of randomness, minimum required return, and probability of obtaining a return exceeding an investor-defined threshold. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biased randomization; Constrained portfolio optimization; Financial assets; Metaheuristics; Simulation; Variable neighborhood search","Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Financial data processing; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Biased randomization; Financial assets; Metaheuristic; NP-hard; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Randomisation; Simulation; Uncertainty; Variable neighborhood search; Heuristic algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120438254"

With the consideration of some real-world constraints, especially the cardinality constraints, the problem becomes much more challenging as it converts to a mixed-integer quadratic multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose a knowledge-based constructive estimation of distribution algorithm (KC-EDA) with the following three features. First, a hybrid design of Ant colony optimization (ACO) and Estimation distribution algorithm (EDA) is used to solve this mixed-variable optimization problem based on knowledge information. Second, a knowledge accumulation mechanism is designed to discover the internal relationship among the assets. The mechanism can not only guide the selection of assets effectively but also enable the use of historical information during evolution to direct the allocation of investment proportion. Third, a constructive approach is applied to construct portfolios under the constraints. This hybrid and constructive approach is incorporated into the multi-objective evolutionary framework and the experiment has been performed on the SZ50, SZ180, and SZ380 datasets (from January 2014 to December 2018).

Unlike the ℓ1-norm based methods, the no-short-selling constraints can be directly used in our proposed model. Besides, a sparse regularization term is introduced to eliminate trivial trades in the SSPO system.

It is assumed that the feasible region of the constrained optimization problem is defined by a convex-hull of multiple vertices. On the other hand, without loss of generality, the search space of EA is given by a hyper-cube. The proposed CHT called Convex-Hull Mapping (CHM) transforms the real vector in the search space of EA into the solution in the feasible region. It is also proven that CHM performs a surjective mapping from the search space of EA to the feasible region. Although the proposed CHM can be applied to any EAs, one of the latest EAs, or Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE), is used in this paper. By using ADE, CHM is compared with conventional CHTs in a real-world optimization problem in the field of finance, namely the portfolio optimization problem. Portfolio optimization is the process of determining the best proportion of investment in different assets according to some objective. Specifically, to reveal the characteristic of CHM depending on the number of the above vertices, three different formulations of the portfolio optimization problem are employed to evaluate the performance of ADE using CHM. Numerical experiments show that CHM is better than conventional CHTs in most cases. Moreover, the hybrid method combining CHM with a conventional CHT outperforms the original CHT. © 2022 The Author(s).

The proposed method can also push notifications automatically when the system detects that the trend of the user's portfolio is going to slow down, and reminds them to invest in new portfolios with a strong uptrend in a timely manner.

Here, we consider a more general model that allows multiple weighted thresholds, and propose three novel trading strategies built within the DC paradigm. To optimize the weights of the thresholds, we use a genetic algorithm and manage to find strategies that outperform previously known single-threshold strategies under the common efficiency metrics.

Portfolio optimization is an effective way for investors to disperse investment risk and increase portfolio return. Under the assumption of no short selling, a bi-objective minimizing portfolio optimization model, in which the first objective is a semi-absolute deviation mean function used to measure the portfolio risk, and the second objective is a maximum entropy smooth function used to measure the portfolio return, is given in this paper. Also, a maximum entropy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is designed to solve the bi-objective portfolio optimization model. In order to obtain a sufficient number of uniformly distributed portfolio Pareto optimal solutions located on the true Pareto frontier and fully exploit the useful asset combination modes which can lead the search process toward the frontier direction quickly in the objective space, a subspace multi-parent uniform crossover operator and a subspace decomposition mutation operator are given. Furthermore, a normalization method to deal with the tight constraint and the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm are also discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by five benchmark investment optimization problems. The performance evaluations and results analyses illustrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying good Pareto solutions and maintaining adequate diversity of the evolution population. Also, the proposed algorithm can obtain faster and better convergence to the true portfolio Pareto frontier compared with the three state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

This paper uses quadratic programming algorithms and genetic algorithms as well as quadratic programming algorithms, Matlab planning solutions for genetic algorithms, and genetic algorithm toolboxes to solve Markowitz's mean variance model. The mathematical model for introducing sparse portfolio strategies uses the decomposition method of penalty functions as an algorithm for solving nonconvex sparse optimization strategies to solve financial portfolio problems. The merging speed of the quadratic programming algorithm is fast, and the merging speed depends on the selection of the initial value. The genetic algorithm performs very well in global searches, but local search capabilities are insufficient and the pace of integration into the next stage is slow. To solve this, using a genetic algorithm toolbox is quick and easy. The results of the experiments show that the final solution of the decomposition method of the fine function is consistent with the solution of the integrity of the genetic algorithm. 67% of the total funds will be spent on local car reserves and 33% on wine reserves. When data scales are small, quadratic programming algorithms and genetic algorithms can provide effective portfolio feedback, and the method of breaking down penalty functions to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of algorithm combinations is widely used in sparse financial portfolio issues.  © 2022 He Li and Naiyu Shi.","","Algorithms; Financial Management; Investments; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results; Functions; Investments; MATLAB; Merging; Quadratic programming; Decomposition methods; Financial investments; Financial portfolio; Genetic optimization algorithm; Investments portfolios; Markowitz; Mean variance model; Optimal allocation; Penalty function; Quadratic programming algorithms; algorithm; financial management; investment; reproducibility; theoretical model; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134891927"

It has brought great challenges to optimization methods due to the complicated search space that has both continuous and discrete variables. This paper considers the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problems that can be formulated as MINLP problems. Since each continuous variable is dependent to a discrete variable, we propose a Compressed Coding Scheme (CCS), which encodes the dependent variables into a continuous one. In this manner, we can reuse some existing search operators and the dependence among variables will be utilized while the algorithm is optimizing the compressed variables. CCS actually bridges the gap between the portfolio optimization problems and the existing optimizers, such as Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The new approach is applied to two benchmark suites, involving the number of assets from 31 to 2235. The experimental results indicate that CCS is not only efficient but also robust for dealing with the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Coding scheme; Evolutionary computations; Mixed-integer programming; Multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization","Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Financial data processing; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Constrained portfolios; Continuous variables; Dependent variables; Mixed integer programming; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Portfolio investment; Portfolio optimization; Integer programming","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108963811"

The main advantage of bio-inspired algorithms over traditional methods is their searching ability. Portfolio selection is a popular optimization problem in economics and finance. It aims to find an optimal allocation of capital among a set of assets by maximization of return with simultaneous minimization of risk. Since the portfolio optimization problem is NP-hard, a large number of researchers have resorted to bio-inspired algorithms to deal with the computational complexity. This study provides an overview of the new generation bio-inspired algorithms from the recently published literature for portfolio optimization.

We approach this issue in this work by considering the selective application of knowledge-augmented operators (local search and a memory of elite solutions) based on the search epoch in which the algorithm finds itself, hence alternating between unbiased search (guided uniquely by the built-in search mechanics of the algorithm) and focused search (intensified by the use of the problem-aware operators). These operators exploit Sharpe index (a measure of the relationship between return and risk) as a source of problem knowledge. We have conducted a sensibility analysis to determine in which phases of the search the application of these operators leads to better results. Our findings indicate that the resulting algorithm is quite robust in terms of parameterization from the point of view of this problem-specific indicator. Furthermore, it is shown that not only can other non-memetic counterparts be outperformed, but that there is a range of parameters in which the MA is also competitive when not better in terms of standard multiobjective performance indicators. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","intensification/diversification; Memetic algorithms; multiobjective optimization; portfolio selection; sharpe index","Evolutionary algorithms; Financial data processing; Investments; Risk assessment; Cardinality constraints; Intensification/diversification; Investments portfolios; Local search; Memetic algorithms; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Sharpe index; Multiobjective optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159404872"

Previous portfolio optimization models use traditional risk measurements such as variance, which symmetrically delineate both positive and negative sides and are not practical and stable. In this paper, a new model with cardinality constraints is first proposed, in which the idiosyncratic volatility factor is used to replace traditional risk measurements and can capture the risks of the portfolio in a more accurate way. The new model has practical constraints which involve the sparsity and irregularity of variables and make it challenging to be solved by traditional Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). To solve the model, a Learning-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm based on Iϵ+ indicator (Iϵ+LGEA) is developed. In Iϵ+LGEA the Iϵ+ indicator is incorporated into the initialization and genetic operators to guarantee the sparsity of solutions and can help improve the convergence of the algorithm. And a new constraint-handling method based on Iϵ+ indicator is also adopted to ensure the feasibility of solutions. The experimental results on five portfolio trading datasets including up to 1226 assets show that Iϵ+LGEA outperforms some state-of-the-art MOEAs in most cases.  © 2021 TUP.","evolutionary algorithm; indicator-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA); portfolio optimization; sparse solution space","Constraint handling; Economic and social effects; Electronic trading; Learning algorithms; Assets management; Guided evolutionary algorithms; Indicator-based evolutionary algorithm; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Portfolio optimization; Risk measurement; Solution space; Sparse solution space; Sparse solutions; Trade off; Evolutionary algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167708089"

In this paper, a co-evolutionary multi-swarm adaptive differential evolution algorithm, namely ECMADE is proposed to solve the premature convergence and search stagnation. First of all, in terms of population structure, based on the parallel distributed framework, ECMADE randomly and evenly divides the population into exploration subpopulation, development subpopulation, and auxiliary subpopulation, and introduces an adaptive information exchange mechanism so that subpopulations can escape local optima in time. Then, a multi-operator parallel search strategy is proposed to keep population diversity and meet the optimization needs of different problems. Finally, an adaptive adjustment mechanism of control parameters is developed, through recent elite parameter archive and weight distribution to fully mine successful parameter information, and generate control parameters with a high success rate for the current evolutionary stage. In order to prove the effectiveness of the ECMADE, 10 test functions and portfolio optimization problem are selected in here. The experiment results show that the ECMADE can effectively solve these test functions, the accuracy and efficiency is superior to those of two classical DE algorithms. The actual application results show that the ECMADE can significantly improve the ability of portfolio to resist extreme losses, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the ECMADE once again. The ECMADE has better optimization performance by comparing with some well-known algorithms in term of the solution quality, robustness and space distribution.

There are many portfolio optimization models, among which is the Mean-Variance (MV) model. This model minimizes the portfolio variances that represents the risk in investment. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a heuristic method that can be used to solve the portfolio optimization problems. This method is inspired by the movement of honey bee colonies when searching for food. In this study, both the Cardinality-constrained mean-variance (CCMV) model and Improved Quick Artificial Bee Colony (iqABC) method were used. In this case, the CCMV model is a modification of the MV model which adds the cardinality constraint, quantity constraints, and the investor risk tolerance parameter. Meanwhile, the iqABC method is developed from the ABC method. The implementation shows that the choice of parameters in CCMV model must be chosen carefully, since the choice may help the investors compose the portfolio that suits their risk tolerance with diversification in mind. The implementation also shows the iqABC method on CCMV model generates a portfolio with better returns and Sharpe ratio values compared to those of mABC methods and the market. © 2020 Author(s).","cardinality-constrained mean-variance model; improved quick artificial bee colony method; Portfolio","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086645753"

The higher investment value obtained by a country, the faster the country is able to develop their prosperity. However, the investor faces some obstacle in investment activity to have a reasonable return and acceptable risk. In stock investments area, investors could increase chance of getting higher returns by making predictions and diversifying by forming a stock portfolio. Previous studies have stated that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which are one of the machine learning models inspired by the activity of human brain cells have more advantages to predict the stock future value in terms of speed, accuracy, and the amount of data that can be processed compared to other stock prediction models. Diversification is a method of dividing investment funds into different index stocks, with the aim of reducing the investment risk. With thousands of stocks in the market, deciding which portfolio should be chosen is difficult. This study extends the scope of several previous studies, which are only limited to perform predictions using ANN or GA without forming an optimal stock portfolio. The objective of this study is to predict future stock values using ANN, then form those optimal stock portfolios using GA with aims to get the best optimization of maximal return and minimal risk value.

It aims to find a trade-off between risk and expected return for the investors, who want to invest finite capital in a set of available assets. Furthermore, constrained portfolio optimization problems are of particular interest in real-world scenarios where practical aspects such as cardinality (among others) are considered. Both mathematical programming and meta-heuristic approaches have been employed for handling this problem. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often preferred for constrained portfolio optimization problems involving non-convex models. In this paper, we propose an EA with a tailored variable representation and initialization scheme to solve the problem. The proposed approach uses a short variable vector, regardless of the size of the assets available to choose from, making it more scalable. The solutions generated do not need to be repaired and satisfy some of the constraints implicitly rather than requiring a dedicated technique.

In view of the instability of the financial market, a diversified investment portfolio can help control the loss of the investment portfolio. In addition to paying attention to the safety and return of asset allocation, we cannot ignore the liquidity of assets, that is, their liquidity. Adding high-liquidity products to asset allocation, such as equity investment, can better control the financial cash flow in response to emergencies. One of the ways to make assets flow is to securitize assets and sell them to the market. In order to revitalize the stock assets, good investment efficiency is a necessary choice for financial investment. Various financial products and their derivatives continue to enter people's vision. There are many financial products in reality, and optimizing the investment portfolio can bring high economic benefits. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of optimization algorithms in financial portfolio problems. (1) Monetary policy remains prudent and neutral. It is not easy to expect flooding, but flexibility is required in complex situations. (2) Financial resources are tilted towards innovation and transformation and capital markets, which is beneficial to the development of capital markets in the medium and long term. (3) Unblocking the transmission mechanism is conducive to lenient credit and tapping the wrong killing opportunities in private enterprise debt. (4) Banks and other financial institutions have moderate pressure to give benefits to entities, but in the long run, the interests of the two are consistent. (5) Finance risk prevention will continue, orderly breaking the rigid exchange and reshaping the financial structure and ecology. (6) The pace of opening up of the financial industry has accelerated, and the bond market investor structure has improved. In this paper, we establish different optimization schemes to compare and study the portfolio problem and then use MATLAB to solve the modeling and programming problem, calculate the highest return rate and the lowest risk value before and after optimization, and then make a comparative analysis to get a better optimization scheme. The results show that the genetic algorithm model is superior to the quadratic programming method in terms of risk control. The minimum risk of portfolio optimization through genetic algorithm has been reduced by about 40%, and the maximum return has increased by about 25%. The comprehensive optimization effect is better than the quadratic planning method and ultimately can obtain higher economic benefits. It can be seen that the optimization algorithm is of great significance for the comparative study of financial portfolio problems.  © 2021 Shuai Liu and Chenglin Xiao.","","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; MATLAB; Quadratic programming; Risk assessment; Application studies; Asset allocation; Comparatives studies; Economic benefits; Financial investments; Financial portfolio; Financial products; Investments portfolios; Optimization algorithms; Optimization scheme; Investments","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120797946"

As a result, many approaches have been proposed for obtaining trading strategy portfolio. The group trading strategy portfolio (GTSP) optimization approaches that can be used to provide various trading strategy portfolios were also proposed. Because different criteria should be considered to derive GTSPs, a MOGA (multi-objective genetic algorithm) based approach has been presented for searching non-dominated solutions. In this paper, to extract a better set of non-dominated solutions, we propose a SPEA-based algorithm for deriving GTSPs with two objective functions.

Portfolio diversification, as stated in modern portfolio theory, is a go-to solution to manage risks. The purpose of portfolio diversification is to reduce the return's variance compared with a single stock investment or undiversified portfolio. The primary motivation of this research is to investigate the portfolio selection strategies through clustering and application of genetic algorithm. Cluster analysis serves as a method to cluster assets with similar financial ratio scores which is the scores of Earnings/Share (EPS), Price/Earnings Ratio (PER), Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG), Return on Asset (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Debt to Equity Ratio (DER). By clustering method, homogeneous clusters are produced and can be used in diversifying portfolio. In this paper, Agglomerative Clustering (AC) is used as the clustering method. Then Genetic Algorithm (GA) will be applied to each resulting cluster to obtain the optimal proportion of each stock in the portfolio. Genetic algorithm is a searching algorithm based on genetic principles and natural selection. The performance of Genetic Algorithm combined with Agglomerative Clustering (ACGA) in portfolio optimization, evaluated based on some actual datasets, gives a portfolio with bigger expected return than a portfolio constructed with only Genetic Algorithm or a portfolio constructed by uniformly weighted stock. © 2018 Author(s).","Agglomerative Clustering; Genetic Algorithm; Portfolio Optimization; Portfolio Selection","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056145839"

We propose a novel meta-learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which we call MetaRL. It utilizes algorithms from different groups and optimizes their combination.

Moreover, RL naturally takes into account transaction costs and can model real trading when the strategy can impact the market. As agents, we use deep neural networks that decide which of the algorithms will be more profitable at a particular moment.

The demand for smart transportation investment is constantly released. As typical and efficient financial products, asset-backed securities (ABS) can greatly improve the turnover efficiency of funds between upstream suppliers and downstream buyers in the field of smart transportation and also help participants of the supply chain to maintain healthier financial situations. However, one of the most common problems of ABS is portfolio allocation, which needs portfolio optimization based on massive assets with multiple objectives and constraints. Especially, in the field of smart transportation, sources of underlying assets can always be complex, which may involve a variety of subdivision industries and regions. At the same time, due to the relationships between upstream and downstream entities in the supply chain, correlations among assets can be strong. So, during the optimization of smart transportation ABS portfolio allocation, it is necessary to identify and deal with those problems. Different from forward selection or linear optimization, which could have low efficiency for complicated problems with large sample size and multiple objectives, new methods and algorithms for NP-hard problems would be necessary to be investigated. In this article, a penalty function based on graph density (GD) was introduced to the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and a GD-PSO algorithm was proposed. Experiments also showed that the GD-PSO algorithm solved the problem of portfolio optimization in smart transportation supply chain ABS effectively.

The computational results show that threshold optima can exist across all reasonable values of both the payment probability (default risk) and the loss rate (loan collateral). In addition, the procedure reacts positively to portfolios afflicted by either systematic defaults (such as during an economic downturn) or episodic delinquency (i.e., cycles of curing and re-defaulting).

Many techniques and heuristics have been applied to this intractable optimization problem, however swarm intelligence algorithms have been implemented only few times for this task, even though they are known to be very successful for that class of problems. In this paper, we hybridized artificial bee colony algorithm with elements inspired by genetic algorithms to obtain better balance between intensification and diversification, especially during late stages, and applied the proposed improved algorithm to the cardinality constrained mean-variance version of the portfolio selection problem.

Its aim of having the wealth in a period of time with maximum return and minimum risk has been well-defined in the literature. Specifically, the portfolio selection is arisen to be an interesting investment issue. Since the risk is defined as the probability of losses relative to the expected return in the portfolio investment, the existing risk would influence the rate of return and affect the investment decision. In this paper, the portfolio selection problem is discussed. The aim is to provide an effective quantitative study in managing the portfolio. In the beginning, the rates of return are calculated and it is followed by computing the expected rates of return and the related covariance matrix. Accordingly, the mean-variance optimization model, which is the quadratic programming model, is formulated and solved by the quadratic programming technique. Here, the objective function to be minimized represents the risk of the portfolio selection, while the weights of the portfolio selection, which are defined as the decision variables, are normalized with the total amount of investment, and the expected return is assigned to a certain targeted return. For illustration, a set of historical data on the stock prices in the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Bursa Malaysia Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) is considered. Through simulation and optimization of the mean-variance portfolio model, the result shows the relationship between risk and return with the various targeted returns.

The changing dynamics of markets have resulted in higher uncertainties surrounding returns. Returns have often been found to be skewed and extreme events observed to be frequent. These characteristics are measured by skewness and kurtosis, which need to be accommodated in the definition of risk. They should also be included in the portfolio optimization process. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of including higher moments in the estimation of risk in the process of international portfolio diversification. Our study is based on a sample of thirty-three globally traded stock market indexes, including emerging as well as developed markets, for the period between 2000 and 2012. Our inclusion of skewness and kurtosis makes portfolio optimization a nonlinear, nonconvex and multi-objective problem; this has been solved with the use of a genetic algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the higher moments model outperforms the traditional mean–variance model across the time period. The results of this study may be useful to fund managers, portfolio managers and investors, aiding them in understanding the behavior of the stock market and in selecting an optimal portfolio model among various alternative portfolio models. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Genetic algorithm (ga); Global indexes; Kurtosis; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio performance; Skewness","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052709698"

A credibilistic multiobjective mean-VaR model is formulated for the multiperiod portfolio selection problem, whereby the return is quantified by the credibilistic mean and the risk is measured by the credibilistic VaR. We also consider liquidity, cardinality, and upper and lower bound constraints to obtain a more realistic model. Furthermore, to solve the proposed model efficiently, an improved multiobjective bat algorithm termed IMBA is designed, in which three new strategies, i.e., the global best solution selection strategy, candidate solution generation strategy, and competitive learning strategy, are proposed to increase the convergence speed and improve the solution quality. Finally, comparative experiments are presented to show the applicability and superiority of the proposed approaches from two aspects. First, the designed IMBA is compared with seven typical algorithms, i.e., multiobjective particle swarm optimization, multiobjective artificial bee colony, multiobjective firefly algorithm, multiobjective differential evolution, multiobjective bat, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2), on a number of benchmark test problems.

A series of computational experiments illustrate how these hybrid approach can include uncertainty into the model, and how this is an essential contribution for informed decision making. A relevant novelty is the inclusion of a sustainability dimension, which allows managers to select and prioritize projects not only based on their monetary profitability but also taking into account the associated environmental and/or social impact.

With advances in artificial intelligence, many studies have indicated that deep reinforcement learning (RL) can perform well in quantitative trading by predicting price change trends in the financial market. However, most of the related frameworks display poor generalizability in the testing stage. Thus, we incorporated adversarial learning and a novel sampling strategy for RL portfolio management. The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model's robustness. Moreover, to improve the model's computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6 %-7 %, and profit increased by nearly 45 %.

Mean-semivariance optimization simpli- fies this problem by using only the first two moments of the distribution and by penalizing returns below a predetermined reference. Although this penalty introduces a nonlinearity, mean-semivariance optimization can be performed easily and effciently using the critical line algorithm (CLA) provided that the covariance matrix is estimated from a historical record of asset returns. In practice, this proviso is not restrictive. This chapter reviews the theory of the CLA and presents sample computer code for applying the algorithm to mean-variance and mean- semivariance portfolio optimization.

Diversification is a technique to improve the performance of the portfolio by minimizing the risk of the portfolio. The motivation of this research is to investigate the portfolio selection strategies through clustering method and application of the genetic algorithm. Clustering is used to diversify the portfolio by forming a homogenous cluster with respect to their financial ratios. Seven financial ratio characteristics that used are Earning Per Share (EPS), Price Earnings Ratio (PER), Price / Earnings Growth (PEG), Return of Equity (ROE), Debt Equity Ratio (DER), Current Ratio (CR) and Profit Margin (PM). Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) used as clustering method, then Genetic Algorithm (GA) used for portfolio selection. GA automatically select the optimum risk and return portfolio based on the clustered stocks by deciding which assets and their respective weights included in the portfolio. The GA constructed based on Mean Variance Cardinality Constrained Portfolio Optimization (MVCCPO) model and called a Constrained Genetic Algorithm. The method successfully gives a higher level of return (41.05 %) and Sharpe ratio (32.67) compared to the S&P 500 index in the same period of time (12.34 % and 2.7 respectively). © 2019 Author(s).","Density-based spatial clustering; diversification; investing","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075024378"

The limitation of this study is that the risk of an investment portfolio measured by Value-at-Risk, and each investor has the nature of risk aversion. To solve these problems: First, we established the mean vector and covariance matrix. The second step was to define the vector mean and covariance matrices for the formulation of Value-at-Risk of the investment portfolio. Third, using the mean vector and Value-at-Risk established the model. To complete the optimization problem, we performed the Genetic Algorithm. The results show that the trade-off between risk and expected return does not only depend on the type of investor but also on the size of the investment. The Genetic Algorithm certifies us the robust solution in the optimization problem because of its natural ability to locate the global minimal. Moreover, genetic algorithm can be used as an effective way in numerical completion of the optimization of quadratic investment portfolio.

The most familiar and widely used approach in the field of portfolio optimization is the mean–variance framework introduced by Markowitz. Following this pioneering work, many researchers have extended this model to make it more practical and adapt to real-life problems. In this study, one of these extensions, the cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem, is considered. Cardinality constraints transform the quadratic optimization model into the mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, which is proved to be NP-Hard, making it harder to obtain an optimal solution within a reasonable time by using exact solution methodologies. Hence, the vast majority of the researchers have taken advantage of approximate algorithms to overcome arising computational difficulties. To develop an efficient solution approach for cardinality constrained portfolio optimization, in this study, a parallel variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with quadratic programming is proposed. While the variable neighborhood search algorithm decides the combination of assets to be held in the portfolio, quadratic programming quickly calculates the proportions of assets. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on five well-known datasets and compared with other solution approaches in the literature. Obtained results confirm that the proposed solution approach is very efficient especially on the portfolios with low risk and highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asynchronous parallelization; Metaheuristics; Portfolio optimization; Quadratic programming; Variable neighborhood search","Constrained optimization; Decision making; Financial data processing; Learning algorithms; Quadratic programming; Approximate algorithms; Cardinality constraints; Constrained portfolios; Decision-making strategies; Mixed integer quadratic programming; Quadratic optimization; State-of-the-art algorithms; Variable neighborhood search; Integer programming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083714911"

According to the reviewed studies, the implementation of the robust optimization approach and the invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is the research gap in this field. The contribution of this paper is the development of the PPO problem with the help of the robust optimization approach and the multi-objective IWO algorithm. Considering the profit margin uncertainty in real-world investment decisions, the robust optimization approach is used to address this issue. To illustrate the real-world applicability of the model, it is implemented for dairy products of Pegah Golpayegan Company in Iran. The numerical results obtained from the IWO algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in tracing out the efficiency frontier of the product portfolio. The average risk of efficient frontier solutions in the deterministic model is about 0.4 and for the robust counterpart formulation is at least 0.5 per product. The efficient frontier solutions obtained from robust counterpart formulation demonstrate a more realistic risk level than the deterministic model.

At present, the research mainly focuses on genetic algorithm, quadratic programming, ant colony algorithm and so on, and the results are relatively many. But these algorithms still have some shortcomings. Intelligent algorithm is a general term for a class of algorithms. It means that human beings are inspired by the collective behaviors of various organisms in nature and find better optimal strategies by imitating these intelligent behaviors. With the progress of science and technology, some of the traditional optimization method has been unable to effectively solve complex problems in reality, especially the NP hard problem. The scholars began to adopt more population of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is used to, and showed the significant advantage. In the field of engineering application and scientific research, Swarm intelligence algorithm is paid more and more attention by scholars.

In this study, special emphasis is devoted to the application of a risk-engine, which is based on the contemporary concept of liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk (LVaR), to multivariate optimization of investment portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the modeling parameters of LVaR technique under event market settings and discusses how to integrate asset liquidity risk into LVaR models. Finally, the authors discuss scenario optimization algorithms for the assessment of structured investment portfolios and present a detailed operational methodology for computer programming purposes and prospective research design with the backing of a graphical flowchart. Findings: To that end, the portfolio/risk manager can specify different closeout horizons and dependence measures and calculate the necessary LVaR and resulting investable portfolios. In addition, portfolio managers can compare the return/risk ratio and asset allocation of obtained investable portfolios with different liquidation horizons in relation to the conventional Markowitz´s mean-variance approach. Practical implications: The examined optimization algorithms and modeling techniques have important practical applications for portfolio management and risk assessment, and can have many uses within machine learning and artificial intelligence, expert systems and smart financial applications, financial technology (FinTech), and within big data environments. In addition, it provide key real-world implications for portfolio/risk managers, treasury directors, risk management executives, policymakers and financial regulators to comply with the requirements of Basel III best practices on liquidly risk. Originality/value: The proposed optimization algorithms can aid in advancing portfolios selection and management in financial markets by assessing investable portfolios subject to meaningful operational and financial constraints. Furthermore, the robust risk-algorithms and portfolio optimization techniques can aid in solving some real-world dilemmas under stressed and adverse market conditions, such as the effect of liquidity when it dries up in financial and commodity markets, the impact of correlations factors when there is a switching in their signs and the integration of the influence of the nonlinear and non-normal distribution of assets’ returns in portfolio optimization and management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithms; Basel III; Finance; liquidity risk; LVaR; Modeling; Optimization; Portfolio analysis; Portfolio management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Value-at-risk","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087552053"

The Sharpe ratio is a common assessment strategy. However, the Sharpe ratio considers an uptrend portfolio high risk because it assesses portfolio risk using standard deviations. Hence, we propose a novel investment strategy, namely, the trend ratio, to assess portfolio risk more accurately by the portfolio trend line. Thus, the uptrend portfolio is not considered high risk and is more consistent with the psychology of investors. In addition to normal trading (long selling), short selling is another common trading method. Short selling is borrowing stocks from stock vendors to sell and then repaying the stock at a lower price to make a profit. This paper proposes investing simultaneously in normal trading and short selling by a trend ratio, which can further increase investment profits and spread risks. This paper also adds certificates of deposit as a portfolio choice to ensure that investors can still make profits. This paper utilizes the global quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm with a quantum NOT-gate (GNQTS) to effectively find the best combination of stocks. To avoid the overfitting problem, this paper employs a sliding window. Specifically, this paper combines the trend ratio, GNQTS, short selling with certificates of deposit, and sliding windows to perform the stock selection. The experimental results are promising, with our proposed method having better performance than the Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the experimental results show that both long selling and short selling investments can increase the performance.  © 2021 IEEE.","Metaheuristics; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratio; Short selling; Sliding window; Stock selection; Trend ratio","Commerce; Decoding; Deposits; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Risk assessment; Sales; Tabu search; Metaheuristic; Performance; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio risks; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Sharpe ratios; Short selling; Sliding Window; Stock selections; Trend ratio; Profitability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120325031"

The aim of a stock portfolio is to minimize the risk of an investment and maximize the return on investment. To construct the optimum portfolio of stocks, one needs a strategy of stock selection and must determine the percentage of investment in each stock selected. In this paper, both the priority index method and genetic algorithm are applied to optimize the stock portfolios in terms of the return. Priority index is used in stock selection based on some parameters: price/earnings (P/E), earnings/share (EPS), wealth creation, undervaluation, and price per earnings/growth (PEG). Stock selection in each sector is determined by choosing the stocks which have a priority index score at least equal to the minimum priority index score of the selected stocks. The minimum priority index score of the selected stock is determined by using a certain scale parameter. The percentage of investment in each selected stock is then determined by using a genetic algorithm. The results showed that increasing the value of scale parameters does not always increase the average return. Moreover, the stock selection with a wealth creation parameter has a higher average return than without a wealth creation parameter. Stock selection using daily data has a higher average return than annual data. The results also showed that the method has an optimum period of up to five months to make an investment decision. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","genetic algorithm; optimization; priority index; stock portfolio","Financial data processing; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; Multivariable control systems; Optimization; Daily datum; Investment decisions; priority index; Re-turn-on; Scale parameter; Stock portfolio; Stock selections; Wealth creation; Investments","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079689371"

Since the practical constraints are considered, the problem is proved to be NP-hard. To solve this complex problem, we decompose it into an asset selection problem and a proportion allocation problem. For the asset selection problem, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is developed to determine which assets are included in the portfolio. Once the asset selection is fixed in each generation of the EDA, the proportion of each asset is determined by solving the proportion allocation problem using the linear programming. To guarantee the diversity of the obtained solutions, the probability model (PM) is divided into a set of sub-PMs according to the decomposition of the objective space. A knowledge-based initialization and a cooperation-based local search are designed to improve the solutions obtained in the initialization stage and the search process, respectively.

Multi-objective genetic algorithm is widely used in portfolio problems because of its ability to deal with large-scale search space independently of the problem domain, and to solve the problem through loop iterative parallel search. However, the local search performance of the existing multi-objective genetic algorithm is relatively weak, and the cross-mutation process ignores the density information around the individual, which limits the search performance of the algorithm to a certain extent. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm investment portfolio scheme. First, the improved Sigmoid function is introduced to realize the adaptive change of the mutation operator, and the population distance between individuals is incorporated into the cross-mutation operation to optimize the search performance of the algorithm. A large number of experiments show that this scheme can be used to solve the Pareto optimal solution set of the portfolio optimization problem, and it has faster convergence than the multi-objective genetic algorithm before the improvement, which can effectively improve the Pareto optimization of the securities investment portfolio.

In this work, a deterministic method of decomposition of EFs into a short sequence of sub-EFs is presented. These sub-EFs may be calculated by a quadratic programming algorithm, the collection of such sub-EFs then being subjected to a sifting process to produce the full EF. Full EFs of portfolio optimisation problems with small-cardinality constraints are computed to a high resolution, providing a fast and practical alternative to randomised algorithms.

Existing offloading schemes mainly focus on selecting a subset of mobile nodes to work as offloadees, who first download the contents through the infrastructure, and then transmit them to subscriber nodes. However, when there is large amount of contents to be offloaded, and if all contents are disseminated through only one fixed set of offloadees every time, it may result in the risk of extreme cases that only extremely few nodes received the content, even if the expectation is large. This is like putting all of your eggs in one basket. To deal with this problem, we introduce an economic concept, conditional value at risk (CVaR) to measure the risk in offloadee set selection. CVaR is a widely used risk assessment measure for investments, which provides a unified and comprehensive risk evaluation framework for complex investment portfolio. We propose an algorithm to compute a portfolio over multiple offloadee sets with a guarantee on CVaR. Moreover, we prove the feasibility of our methodology from the mathematical point of view. Extensive evaluations with real-world traces show that our proposed offloading scheme can obtain a portfolio with significantly better CVaR, i.e., 91.53 percent performance gain at most, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","CVaR; device-to-device; opportunistic network; portfolio optimization; risk control; Traffic offloading","Cellular radio systems; Financial data processing; Investments; Mobile telecommunication systems; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Wireless networks; Assessment measures; Comprehensive risks; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Explosive growth; Infrastructure networks; Investment portfolio; Performance Gain; Portfolio optimization; Delay tolerant networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095791768"

Due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, the portfolio needs to be rebalanced to retain the desired risk–return characteristics. The process of rebalancing requires buying or selling of assets that incur transaction costs. This study proposes a tri-objective portfolio optimization model with risk, return and transaction cost as the objectives. Various practical constraints like cardinality, self-financing, quantity, pre-assignment and cost related constraints are included in the proposed model. Three popular risk measures namely variance, Value-At-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-At-Risk (CVaR) are studied in the proposed work. The emphasis of the study is on handling equality constraints like self-financing constraint and the constraints arising from the inclusion of transaction cost models using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). A novel repair algorithm is proposed that can effectively handle equality constraints without any requirement of any constraint handling technique. The proposed repair algorithm is suitable for a larger class of separable transaction cost model. The theoretical proof is given to ensure the validity of our claim. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach three algorithms from different multi-objective evolutionary frameworks are adapted and compared.

In general, portfolio optimization aims to maximize the expected return, and at the same time, minimize the portfolio risk. Various mathematical techniques have been employed in the task of portfolio optimization, ranging from the classical non-integer programming method and statistical-based principal component analysis, to the more recent metaheuristic approach. Specifically, metaheuristic-based methods have gained much attention from the research community, owing to their excellent search capabilities. Two metaheuristic-based approaches, namely genetic algorithm and harmony search algorithm, are considered in this work. A common dataset is used to compare the performance of the two algorithms. The algorithms are studied using different operators and parameters values. The performance of the best portfolio, found by the metaheuristic algorithms, is evaluated using the Sharpe ratio.

It aims for finding the best allocation of resources for a set of assets. This problem has been studied and different models have been proposed since the classical Mean-Variance model was introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and the later modified version by William Sharpe. The inclusion of real-life constraints to the problem has led to the introduction of the extended Mean-Variance model. However, the successes of nature-inspired algorithms in hard computational optimization problems have encouraged researchers to design and apply these algorithms for a variety of optimization problems. In this paper, we design and adapt a Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) for the unconstrained and constrained portfolio optimization problems. SSA is a very recent swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the dynamic foraging behavior of flying squirrels. The proposed SSA metaheuristic approach is compared with a variety of approaches presented in the literature such as classical single metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristic approaches and multi-objective optimization approaches for portfolio optimization. Comparative analysis and computational results using different performance indicators show the superiority of the proposed approach for the unconstrained portfolio optimization using both extended Mean-Variance and Sharpe models. For the constrained version of the problem, the proposed approach has also achieved highly competitive results for the different models adopted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Markowitz; Mean-variance; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe; Squirrel search algorithm; Swarm Intelligence","Constrained optimization; Financial data processing; Multiobjective optimization; Swarm intelligence; Markowitz; Mean variance; Mean variance model; Meta-heuristic approach; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Search Algorithms; Sharpe; Squirrel search algorithm; Swarm intelligence; Learning algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105099567"

This study examined the investment strategies of two competitive retailers who considered whether to invest a shared contract manufacturer (CM) or not. The supply chain members’ operational decisions in four scenarios were analyzed through a Cournot competition model, and the paths of the retailers’ investment strategies were examined. The CM’s capacity portfolio optimization was NP‐hard in nature, and was modelled by an investment portfolio problem. Results show that both retailers jointly invest the CM only when the difference of production costs is not high, and the intentions of joint investment will decrease when the coefficient of spillover and the degree of substitutability between products increase. The CM always benefits as long as one retailer invests, and allocates more investment on the capacity with highest revenue when he emphasizes more on the profit. For optimizing the CM’s capacity portfolio problem, an artificial fish swam algorithm with uniform mutation (AFSA_UM) is developed and it shows better convergent performance and higher robustness than the basic AFSA. © 2019 CPE, University of Maribor.

Due to the high complexity and huge amount of data involved in financial applications, the critical task of constructing appropriate machine learning models will surely become more challenging. Typically, data scientists or researchers may employ various optimizers to enhance the feature selection and/or tuning of the involved hyper-parameters in order to improve the overall performance of the obtained learning models. In this paper, a very flexible optimizer, namely the Adaptive Multi-Population optimization Algorithm (AMPOA), utilizing multiple populations with different search strategies is considered in which two of its variants are carefully evaluated with the other state-of-Theart optimizers to enhance the feature selection process of the commonly used K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach on a set of 12 well-known benchmark problems. The first variant named the BAMPOA-R approach employs a rounding technique to determine on the binary decision of choosing an input feature or not for the underlying classifier while the other BAMPOA-T approach utilizes a specific transform function to decide on the feature selection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimizer for financial applications, the BAMPOA-R approach with the best performance in the previous test is integrated with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm to compare against other regressors on 10 major financial market indexes. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed AMPOA approach to enhance the prediction performances of the underlying machine learning models through more vigorous feature selection for numerous real-world applications including those challenging problems in computational finance. © 2020 IEEE.","binary optimization; feature selection; machine learning; metaheuristic algorithms; stock market prediction","Data communication systems; Data Science; Electronic trading; Feature extraction; Fintech; Nearest neighbor search; Smart city; Support vector regression; Computational finance; Financial applications; Generalization capability; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Machine learning models; Optimization algorithms; Prediction performance; Support vector regression (SVR); Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105296999"

First, the risk and return of investment are measured using multiple methods, and several portfolio methods are introduced. Second, there are problems of fraud risk, underlying assets, and asymmetry risk when assets are being transformed into securitization. The blockchain technology is used to reduce the probability of these risks and improve investment security. Finally, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is applied to the optimization of the blockchain investment portfolio. Since the traditional ABC algorithm can only solve the problem of single-objective optimization, an external population is constructed to improve it. The results show that the improved ABC algorithm can simultaneously optimize multiple features in the investment portfolio, reduce the error of investors when making decisions, and improve the balance between investment returns and risks. At the same time, after the algorithm is evaluated, it is found that the accuracy and practicality have been improved to a certain extent. Also, it is proved that the ABC algorithm can solve the problem of portfolio optimization, improve the security of asset securitization, and ensure the balance of investment return and risk to a certain extent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Blockchain technology; Investment portfolio; Investment risk","Blockchain; Economics; Financial data processing; Investments; Optimization; Risk assessment; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Investment portfolio; Investment returns; Multiple features; Portfolio optimization; Return of investments; Single objective optimization; Fintech","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091626739"

With advances in artificial intelligence, many studies have indicated that deep reinforcement learning (RL) can perform well in quantitative trading by predicting price change trends in the financial market. However, most of the related frameworks display poor generalizability in the testing stage. Thus, we incorporated adversarial learning and a novel sampling strategy for RL portfolio management. The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model&#x2019;s robustness. Moreover, to improve the model&#x2019;s computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6%&#x2013;7%, and profit increased by nearly 45%.

To simulate the real transactions in financial market, multiple decision criteria in portfolio selection should be considered to provide investors with additional choices. This paper discusses a multi-objective portfolio optimization problem for practical portfolio selection in fuzzy environment, in which the return rates and the turnover rates are characterized by fuzzy variables. Under the premise of meeting the two wishes level of investors’ maximum and minimum risk, we assume that the rate of return is a fuzzy variable, and get the corresponding fuzzy portfolio optimization model. What’s more, we apply a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the proposed multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection models. To reflect investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives, a fuzzy decision technique is employed to transform the proposed model into a single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem.

Therefore, we added a series of constraints into basic portfolio optimization model, which reflect the realistic investment environment, such as skewness and kurtosis.

After the server deployment problems under traditional edge computing are analyzed and researched, a task resource allocation model based on multi-stage is proposed to solve the communication problem between different supporting devices. This model establishes a combined task resource allocation and task offloading method and optimizes server execution by utilizing the time delay and energy consumption required for task execution and comprehensively considering the restriction processes of task offloading, partition, and transmission. For the MEC process that supports dense networks, a multi-hybrid intelligent algorithm based on energy consumption optimization is proposed. The algorithm converts the original problem into a power allocation problem via a heuristic model. Simultaneously, it determines the appropriate allocation strategy through distributed planning, duality, and upper bound replacement. Results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage combination-based service deployment optimization model can solve the problem of minimizing the maximum task execution energy consumption combined with task offloading and resource allocation effectively. The algorithm has good performance in handling user fairness and the worst-case task execution energy consumption. The proposed hybrid intelligent algorithm can partition tasks into task offloading sub-problems and resource allocation sub-problems, meeting the user’s task execution needs. A comparison with the latest algorithm also verifies the model’s performance and effectiveness.

In practice, this proviso is not restrictive. This chapter reviews the theory of the CLA and presents sample computer code for applying the algorithm to mean-variance and mean-semivariance portfolio optimization. It also reviews a method for finding the efficient mean-semivariance portfolio for any given feasible desired expected portfolio return. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

Because investors always want an approach that can continually provide various portfolios, the issue of group stock portfolio optimization (GSPO) has been raised and the algorithms to obtain a group stock portfolio (GSP) have also been described in the past. A GSP divides the whole set of stocks into several stock groups, and the stocks in a group are exchangeable in investment. Thus, when investors are not satisfied with a suggested stock, they can select another stock from the same group to replace the original one. However, the industry diversity of stocks within a group is not regarded in the existing literatures. In this paper, an algorithm for dealing with the diverse group stock portfolio optimization (DGSPO) is proposed to obtain a diverse group stock portfolio (DGSP). The proposed algorithm is based on the group genetic algorithm with the chromosome representation and the fitness function designed for the purpose of finding a good DGSP. Especially, a factor called group diversity is designed to diversify stocks from different industries and is considered in the fitness evaluation. Another factor considers cash dividend is also applied to keep companies with good quality in the portfolio for increasing the profit of a DGSP. Two real financial datasets are used in the experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.","group diversity; group stock portfolio; grouping genetic algorithm; grouping problem; Stock portfolio","Chromosomes; Commerce; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Multivariable control systems; Effective approaches; Fitness evaluations; Fitness functions; Group diversity; Grouping genetic algorithms; Grouping problem; Stock portfolio; Trading strategies; Electronic trading","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074693427"

Stock diversification is one of the solutions to optimize stock portfolio, where a diverse portfolio tends to have less risk than the undiversified one. Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering method. Applying diversification concept, agglomerative clustering is used to cluster 40 different assets based on their financial ratio scores (Current Ratio, Debt-Equity Ratio, Profit Margin, Return on Equity, Price/Earnings per Growth, EPS diluted, and Price/Earnings Ratio). Genetic algorithm is search method based on principles of natural selection and genetics. After the stocks are clustered, Genetic algorithm with heuristic crossover is applied to each cluster alongside to determine the proportion of each stock. In this paper, a possibilistic mean-semi-absolute deviation optimization model is used where cardinality, quantity, and transaction cost are considered as constraints. We also use the assumption that the returns of risky assets are fuzzy numbers. The implementation shows that the method gave a higher level of return (29.77 %) and Sharpe's ratio (18.71) compared to S&P 500 index in the same period of time (12.34 % and 2.7 respectively). © 2019 Author(s).","agglomerative clustering; genetic algorithm; optimization model; Portfolio optimization","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075005935"

Using a matheuristic framework that combines an iterated local search metaheuristic with quadratic programming, ARPO efficiently deals with complex variants of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problem, including the well-known cardinality and quantity constraints. ARPO proceeds in two steps. First, a feasible initial solution is constructed by allocating portfolio weights according to the individual return rate. Secondly, an iterated local search framework, which makes use of quadratic programming, gradually improves the initial solution throughout an iterative combination of a perturbation stage and a local search stage. According to the experimental results obtained, ARPO is very competitive when compared against existing state-of-the-art approaches, both in terms of the quality of the best solution generated as well as in terms of the computational times required to obtain it. Furthermore, we also show that our algorithm can be used to solve variants of the portfolio optimization problem, in which inputs (individual asset returns, variances and covariances) feature a random component. Notably, the results are similar to the benchmark constrained efficient frontier with deterministic inputs, if variances and covariances of individual asset returns comprise a random component. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to test the stability of our algorithm against small variations in the input data. © 2019 by the authors.","Biased randomization; Constrained portfolio optimization; Efficiency indices; Financial assets; Iterated local search; Metaheuristics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072262501"

Performances of the weighted norm penalized mvp are examined with two benchmark data sets. When the sample size is not large in comparison with the number of assets, the weighted norm penalized mvp tends to have a lower out-of-sample portfolio variance, lower turnover rate, fewer numbers of active constituents and shortsale positions, but higher Sharpe ratio than the one without such penalty.

Then a modified Harmony search algorithm called HSDS based on Dimensional-Selection (DS) strategy and dynamic fret width (FW) strategy is proposed to solve PO problems, in which the DS strategy is for avoiding generating invalid solutions and the FW strategy is to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search are compared with the HSDS algorithm employing five portfolio problems (HangSeng, DAX 100, FTSE 100, S&P 100 and Nikkei).

There are no efficiently solutions using traditionally approaches to solve the non-linear portfolio optimization problem. And the previous models based on expected return-variance cannot meet the needs of the investors. In this paper, firstly, we present a semi-variance model which including cardinality constraints. The return per unit of risk is the key factor to determine an investment decision and the extended model includes two sets of constraints: bounds on holdings, cardinality. The first set of constraints guarantee that the amount invested (if any) in each asset is between its predetermined upper and lower bounds. The cardinality constraint ensures that the total number of assets selected in the portfolio is equal to a predefined number. Secondly, in order to solve the nonlinear optimization model, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm (IABC) is designed. In addition, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the modelling idea and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","","Investments; Nonlinear programming; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Cardinality constraints; Expected return; Financial investments; Investment decisions; Nonlinear optimization model; Portfolio optimization; Upper and lower bounds; Financial data processing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925339094"

However, it is really challenging work for an investor to choose stocks which might be profitable, to determine the capital allocations for these selected stocks or even to time the transactions for stocks. In this study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), support vector regression (SVR), and genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to design a three-stage portfolio optimization approach for sequentially solving the portfolio selection, portfolio optimization, and transaction timing. Stocks in the semiconductor and iron and steel subsectors in Taiwan are used to illustrate the procedures for applying the present approach. Based on the investment results from 26 May 2017 to 25 Aug. 2017, the annualized returns on investment are 15.36% and 6.15% for the stock markets of the semiconductor and iron and steel sub-sections, respectively. Both returns are superior to the one-year certificate of deposit of about 1% in Taiwan.

None of these studies, however, take into account nonconvex transaction costs, which are present in practical situations. To make a piecewise linear approximation of the transaction cost function, we utilized special ordered set type two constraints. Moreover, we devised a subgradient-based cutting plane algorithm to handle a large number of scenarios. This cutting plane algorithm needs to solve a mixed integer linear programming problem in each iteration, and this requires a substantial computation time. Thus, we also devised a two-phase cutting plane algorithm that is even more efficient.

It is based on the portfolio selection problem, which is well known in financial management. The idea of optimizing a portfolio of investments according to both expected return and risk is transferred to evolutionary selection, and fitness assignment is reinterpreted as the allocation of capital to the individuals in the population, while taking into account both individual quality and population diversity. The resulting selection procedure, which unifies parental and environmental selection, is instantiated by defining a suitable notion of (random) return for multiobjective optimization. Preliminary experiments on multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem instances show that such a procedure is able to preserve diversity while promoting convergence towards the Pareto-optimal front. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Evolutionary algorithms; Fitness assignment; Multiobjective knapsack problem; Portfolio selection; Sharpe ratio","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Problem solving; Fitness assignment; Knapsack problems; Multidimensional knapsack problems; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Portfolio selection problems; Sharpe ratios; Multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921746561"

Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the effectual and widely used optimization technique based on swarm intelligence. Mixing co-variance principles with ABC algorithm assists in quick convergence with more precision. This paper presents a novel co-variance guided Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for portfolio optimization. As portfolio optimization consists of simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, this algorithm is named as Multi-objective Co-variance based ABC (M-CABC).

In this study, extensive experiments using real-world data obtained from one of the most dynamic environments is used - Financial Markets. Additionally, a Multi-Objective Evolutionary System is used to predict future asset price evolution. Therefore, in this study, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary System to optimize a Trading or Investment Strategy (TS) was developed. The goal was to determine potential buy, sell, or hold conditions in stock markets while still yielding high returns at a minimal risk. Fair and established metrics were used (as described in the text) to evaluate both the returns and the linked risk of the optimized TS. Additionally, these TS are evaluated in several markets using data from the main stock indexes of the most developed economies, such as: NASDAQ, S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX 30, and the NIKKEI 225. The Pareto Fronts obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly showed the inherent tradeoff between risk and return in financial management. Furthermore, the achieved results clearly outperformed both the B&H and S&H strategies. Regardless, the experimental results suggest that the positive connection between the gains for training data and test data, which was usually implied in the single-objective proposals, may not necessarily hold true in all circumstances.

Substantial experimental evidence suggests that human behavior may significantly deviate from the traditional expected utility maximization framework when faced with uncertainty. The problem of portfolio selection should be revised when the investor's preference is for CPT instead of expected utility theory (EUT). However, because of the complexity of the CPT function, little research has investigated the portfolio choice problem based on CPT. In this paper, we present an approach to solve the portfolio optimization in single-period under cumulative prospect theory, based upon the coupling of genetic algorithms with bootstrap method. The computational experiments show that the behavior characteristics of CPT investors when they faced the portfolio composed of risky assets by using the method we proposed. Finally, these phenomena are discussed in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.","bootstrap method; Cumulative prospect theory; genetic algorithms; portfolio optimization","Algorithms; Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision theory; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Behavior characteristic; Bootstrap method; Computational experiment; Cumulative prospect theory; Expected utility theory; Experimental evidence; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Optimization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986551002"

However, it is worth investigating the problem of selecting portfolios while considering not only low risk but also high return on investment. The calculation process of the traditional method is highly complex and is not comprehensive in terms of what it takes into consideration. Hence, this paper proposes a new method to calculate portfolio risk. We utilize funds standardization in order to consider the risk of a portfolio and drastically reduce computation complexity. Funds standardization is able to represent fluctuations of investor mood. Moreover, using a Genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the Sharpe Ratio is able to identify the low risk and stable returns of a portfolio. Moreover, over-fitting is a common problem in the stock market, and so this paper uses sliding windows to avoid the over-fitting problem, and tests all kinds of training periods and testing periods that impact on the portfolio. The experimental results show that the proposed method, compared with the traditional method of calculating risk, is able to identify the optimal portfolio and performs efficiently and outstandingly when it comes to this problem. © 2015 IEEE.","Funds Standardization; Genetic algorithm (GA); Portfolio; Sharpe Ratio","Algorithms; Commerce; Cybernetics; Electronic trading; Finance; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Optimization; Standardization; Assessment strategies; Calculation process; Computation complexity; Optimal portfolios; Over fitting problem; Portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratios; Risk assessment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964509931"

Semi-variance is usually considered as a risk factor in drawing up an efficient frontier and the optimal portfolio. Since semi-variance offers a better estimation of the actual risk portfolio, it was used as a measure to approximate the risk of investment in this work. The optimal portfolio selection is one of the non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problems that have not been presented in an exact algorithm, which can solve this problem in a polynomial time. Meta-heuristic algorithms are usually used to solve such problems. A novel hybrid harmony search and artificial bee colony algorithm and its application were introduced in order to draw efficient frontier portfolios.

Nature-inspired metaheuristics are appropriate for solving such problems; however, literature review shows that there are very few applications of nature-inspired metaheuristics to portfolio optimization problem. This is especially true for swarm intelligence algorithms which represent the newer branch of nature-inspired algorithms. No application of any swarm intelligence metaheuristics to cardinality constrained mean-variance (CCMV) portfolio problem with entropy constraint was found in the literature.

Firefly algorithm is one of the latest, very successful swarm intelligence algorithm; however, it exhibits some deficiencies when applied to constrained problems.

Robust optimization algorithms to set coherent asset allocations for investment management industries in emerging markets and particularly in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) financial markets are developed. The results show that the obtained investable portfolios lie off the efficient frontier, but that long-only portfolios appear to lie much closer to the frontier than portfolios including both long and short-sales positions.

Three parts, grouping, stock, and stock portfolio parts, are used as encoding scheme. The fitness function defined in the previous approach is utilized to evaluate quality of a chromosome. To deal with parameter setting for genetic operations, a fuzzy logic controller is designed and employed to dynamically adjust them using the predefined knowledge base for deriving a better solution.

We analyze the properties of the various models, prove that a performance measure based on a Risk Adjusted version of the Mean Gini Ratio (RAMGR) is coherent, and establish the equivalence between maximizing this performance measure and solving for the maximal Mean-Gini ratio. We propose a linearization approach for the fractional programming formulation of the MGR model.

This modelling approach takes into account both the multidimensional nature of the portfolio selection problem and the requirements imposed by the investor. Concretely, it optimizes the expected return, the downside-risk and the skewness of a given portfolio, taking into account budget, bound and cardinality constraints. The quantification of the uncertain future return on a given portfolio is approximated by means of LR-fuzzy numbers, while the moments of its return are evaluated using possibility theory. The main purpose of this paper is to solve the MDRS portfolio selection model as a whole constrained three-objective optimization problem, what has not been done before, in order to analyse the efficient portfolios which optimize the three criteria simultaneously. For this aim, we propose new mutation, crossover and reparation operators for evolutionary multi-objective optimization, which have been specially designed for generating feasible solutions of the cardinality constrained MDRS problem. We incorporate the operators suggested into the evolutionary algorithms NSGAII, MOEA/D and GWASF-GA and we analyse their performances for a data set from the Spanish stock market. The potential of our operators is shown in comparison to other commonly used genetic operators and some conclusions are highlighted from the analysis of the trade-offs among the three criteria. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The standard model of this problem, called Markowitz mean-variance model, has two conflicting criteria: expected returns and risks. In this paper, we consider a more realistic portfolio optimization problem, including both cardinality and quantity constraints, which is called Markowitz mean-variance cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem (MVCCPO problem). We extend an algorithm which is based on a multi-objective evolutionary framework incorporating a local search schema and non-dominated sorting. To quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we compared our algorithm with the other five algorithms on public available data sets involving up to 225 assets. Several modifications based on the fundamental operators and procedures of the algorithm, namely, the boundary constraint handling strategy, the local search schema, the replacement strategy and the farthest-candidate approach, are proposed one-by-one. Success of this exercise is displayed via simulation results. The experimental results with different cardinality constraints illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of proximity and diversity. In addition, the diversity maintenance strategy used in the algorithm is also studied in terms of a spread metric to evaluate the distribution of the obtained non-dominated solutions.

However, besides portfolio optimisation, a complete investment procedure should also include the selection of profitable investment targets and determine the optimal timing for buying/selling the investment targets. In this study, an integrated procedure using data envelopment analysis (DEA), artificial bee colony (ABC) and genetic programming (GP) is proposed to resolve a portfolio optimisation problem. The proposed procedure is evaluated through a case study on investing in stocks in the semiconductor sub-section of the Taiwan stock market for 4 years. The potential average 6-month return on investment of 9.31% from 1 November 2007 to 31 October 2011 indicates that the proposed procedure can be considered a feasible and effective tool for making outstanding investment plans, and thus making profits in the Taiwan stock market. Moreover, it is a strategy that can help investors to make profits even when the overall stock market suffers a loss. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","artificial bee colony; data envelopment analysis; genetic programming; portfolio optimisation","Algorithms; Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Profitability; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial bee colony algorithms; Effective tool; Investment plan; Optimal timing; Portfolio optimisation; Taiwan stock markets; Investments","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904798690"

In this paper, we studied the extended Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio optimization model. We considered the cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment and round lot constraints in the extended model. These four real-world constraints limit the number of assets in a portfolio, restrict the minimum and maximum proportions of assets held in the portfolio, require some specific assets to be included in the portfolio and require to invest the assets in units of a certain size respectively. An efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained portfolio optimization problem in the extended mean-variance framework. A learning-guided solution generation strategy is incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process to promote the efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search towards the promising regions of the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared against four existing state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm (PESA-II) and Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). Computational results are reported for publicly available OR-library datasets from seven market indices involving up to 1318 assets. Experimental results on the constrained portfolio optimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the four well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with respect to the quality of obtained efficient frontier in the conducted experiments. © 2014 The Authors.

A hybrid approach, which integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and a linear programming (LP) solver is proposed in order to solve the model, where GA is used to search for the assets selection heuristically and the LP solver solves the corresponding sub-problems of weight allocation optimally. Scenarios are generated to capture uncertain prices of assets for five benchmark market instances. The computational results indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm can obtain very promising solutions. Possible future research directions are also discussed. © 2015 IEEE.","Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid Algorithm; Portfolio Optimization; Stochastic Programming","Commerce; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Linear programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Computational results; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Market uncertainty; Mean variance model; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Weight allocation; Electronic trading","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963607064"

The design and operation of such supply portfolio merits decisions of what and when to expand, and how much of each source to use considering interest rates, economies of scale and hydrologic variability. This paper provides an integrated framework to optimize water supply system expansions using dynamic programming and combining short and long term water supply source optimization using quadratic programming. The approach represents water supply infrastructure features and hydrologic conditions under increasing water demands. Results allow (a) identification of tradeoffs between cost and reliability of various expansion paths and supply source decisions, and (b) evaluation of potential gains from water system loss reductions, an often neglected supply augmenting alternative in developing countries. Results show the need for supply infrastructure expansions can be dampened by investments in reduction of systemwide losses. A losses reduction program cutting losses in half will cost R$ 532 million annually with a minimum system reliability of 60 percent. This program would yield net savings of 2.7 percent with respect to the status quo annual costs. Decreasing system losses from fifty to five percent, will cost R$ 547 million per year with a minimum system reliability of 87 percent. Earlier investments in system loss reduction programs will greatly improve reliability and system expansion costs. The framework proves its usefulness for planning its transferability to similarly urbanized systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Capacity expansion optimization; Urban water supply planning; Water supply loss reduction; Water supply portfolios","Cost reduction; Costs; Developing countries; Dynamic programming; Economics; Expansion; Investments; Quadratic programming; Reliability; Water supply systems; Brazil; Capacity expansion; Design and operations; Hydrologic conditions; Integrated simulations; Loss reduction; Urban water supply; Water supply infrastructures; Water supply","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007006511"

Selecting the stocks that simultaneously offer high return and low risk is a difficult problem that is worth investigating. However, the traditional risk calculation based on the modern portfolio theory (MPT) of portfolios has some defects. The MPT method requires the calculations of every relationship between each pair of stocks in the portfolio, entailing high computation complexity, which grows exponentially with the increased number of stocks. Besides, the traditional calculation is unable to calculate the coefficient of variation, and merely considers the relationship between each pair of stocks, so it cannot accurately assess portfolio risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, funds standardization, and utilizes it to represent the portfolio return and calculate portfolio risk. The fluctuation of portfolio funds standardization shows not only the relationships between each pair of stocks, but also the interactions among all stocks. Hence, utilizing funds standardization can accurately assess portfolio risk and completely represent the mood swings of investors. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method significantly reduces the computation complexity because the complexity does not increase when the portfolios stock number increases. We combine the genetic algorithm, Sharpe ratio and funds standardization to find the optimal portfolio. In addition, we utilize the sliding window to avoid the over-fitting problem, which is common in this field, and test the effect of all kinds of training and testing periods. The experimental results show that the portfolio can spread the risk effectively, and that the portfolio risk can be assessed accurately by utilizing the funds standardization. Comparing with the traditional method, our method can identify the optimal portfolio efficiently and establish a portfolio that has lower risk and stable return. © 2013 IEEE.","funds standardization; Genetic algorithm (GA); low volatility; modern portfolio theory; Portfolio; Sharpe ratio; stock selection","Electronic trading; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Optimization; Risk assessment; Standardization; low volatility; Modern portfolio theories; Portfolio; Sharpe ratios; Stock selections; Financial markets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030671849"

Effluent trading can serve as a cost-effective way to achieve optimal configuration of discharge permits in agricultural NPS pollution control. However, great difficulties exist in practical effluent trading planning, including uncertainties related to randomness and imprecision, system risk of nutrient loadings being unacceptably high, and factors with spatiotemporal heterogeneity within the watershed. In this study, an inexact simulation-based stochastic optimization method (ISSOM) is developed for identifying effluent trading strategies in response to the above challenges. With the aid of technique of interval analysis, uncertain parameters related to nutrient yields can be handled and dynamic variation of NPS contaminant loadings can be reasonably addressed. Besides, ISSOM can tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy, stochastic and interval formats and capture the notion of risk under high-variability situation in NPS pollution control. The ISSOM is applied to a real case of agricultural NPS pollution mitigation through effluent trading in Xiangxihe Watershed. Results show that the uncertainties play a major role in successfully launching an effluent trading program, and trading scheme can mitigate agricultural NPS pollution with an increased system benefit. Results also reveal that the agricultural zones of Xiakou and Gufu are the major pollution sources and main purchasers in effluent trading, and Guizhou zone is the main vendor which contributes least to nutrient discharge. These findings can not only facilitate identification of the main pollution sources and optimal effluent trading schemes, but also gain insight into the tradeoff among the agricultural benefit, system risk, and satisfaction degree. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Effluent trading; Fuzzy optimization; Interval simulation; Nonpoint sources; Nutrient transport; Risk analysis","China; Guizhou; Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Effluents; Nutrients; Optimization; Pollution; Pollution induced corrosion; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Stochastic systems; Surface waters; Uncertainty analysis; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Effluent trading; Fuzzy optimization; Interval simulation; Non-point source; Nutrient transport; cost-benefit analysis; effluent; nonpoint source pollution; optimization; pollution control; pollution tax; risk assessment; stochasticity; trade-off; water quality; Pollution control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921456020"

The framework used is an extension of the standard Markowitz mean–variance model that incorporates realistic constraints, such as upper and lower bounds for investment in individual assets and/or groups of assets, and minimum trading restrictions. The inclusion of constraints that limit the number of assets in the final portfolio and piecewise linear transaction costs transforms the selection of optimal portfolios into a mixed-integer quadratic problem, which cannot be solved by standard optimization techniques. We propose to use a genetic algorithm in which the candidate portfolios are encoded using a set representation to handle the combinatorial aspect of the optimization problem. Besides specifying which assets are included in the portfolio, this representation includes attributes that encode the trading operation (sell/hold/buy) performed when the portfolio is rebalanced. The results of this hybrid method are benchmarked against a range of investment strategies (passive management, the equally weighted portfolio, the minimum variance portfolio, optimal portfolios without cardinality constraints, ignoring transaction costs or obtained with L1 regularization) using publicly available data.

Fortunately, after many centuries of mathematical and statistical innovations by visionaries such as Pascal, Bernoulli, Bayes, Gauss, Laplace, and Fermat, and with the explosion of computing technology, uncertainty can increasingly be explained with much more elegance through rigorous, methodological applications.

Furthermore, using investor preferences, one needs to select some good quality assets from a given class to build an optimal portfolio. The focus of this chapter is to present a hybrid approach to portfolio selection using investor preferences in terms of selection of assets from a particular class that suits the given investor-type. The support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel is used to classify the assets into three classes. The optimal portfolio selection is achieved using a model that is based on four financial criteria: short term return, long term return, risk, and liquidity.

The complexity of the optimal asset allocation problem increases with an increase in the number of assets available to select from for investing. The optimization problem becomes computationally challenging when there are more than a few hundreds of assets to select from. To reduce the complexity of large-scale portfolio optimization, two asset preselection procedures that consider return and risk of individual asset and pairwise correlation to remove assets that may not potentially be selected into any portfolio are proposed in this paper. With these asset preselection methods, the number of assets considered to be included in a portfolio can be increased to thousands. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a Normalized Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (NMOEA/D) algorithm and several other commonly used multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are applied and compared. Six experiments with different settings are carried out. The experimental results show that with the proposed methods the simulation time is reduced while return-risk trade-off performances are significantly improved. Meanwhile, the NMOEA/D is able to outperform other compared algorithms on all experiments according to the comparative analysis. © 2017 B. Y.

We introduce a Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance (CCMV) model which incorporates the boundary constraints (such as the bound of portfolio selection proportion of each asset and the number of assets) and considers transaction costs. To enhance the global optimization performance, an improved HS and modified TLBO are synergistically performed using a dynamic selection strategy for balancing the global exploration power and the local exploitation power.

The main results of this work are: developed heuristic approaches for the prospect theory model proposed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 as well as an empirical comparative analysis of this model and the index tracking model. The crucial assumption is that behavioural features of the prospect theory model provide better downside protection than traditional approaches to the portfolio selection problem. In this research the large-scale computational results for the prospect theory model have been obtained for real financial market data with up to 225 assets. Previously, as far as we are aware, only small laboratory tests (2–3 artificial assets) have been presented in the literature. In order to investigate empirically the performance of the behaviourally based model, a differential evolution algorithm and a genetic algorithm which are capable of dealing with a large universe of assets have been developed. Specific breeding and mutation, as well as normalization, have been implemented in the algorithms. A tabulated comparative analysis of the algorithms’ parameter choice is presented. The prospect theory model with the reference point being the index is compared to the index tracking model. A cardinality constraint has been implemented to the basic index tracking and the prospect theory models. The portfolio diversification benefit has been found. The aggressive behaviour in terms of returns of the prospect theory model with the reference point being the index leads to better performance of this model in a bullish market. However, it performed worse in a bearish market than the index tracking model. A tabulated comparative analysis of the performance of the two studied models is provided in this paper for in-sample and out-of-sample tests. The performance of the studied models has been tested out-of-sample in different conditions using simulation of the distribution of a growing market and simulation of the t-distribution with fat tails which characterises the dynamics of a decreasing or crisis market. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behavioural finance; Index tracking; Portfolio optimization; Prospect theory; Risk modelling","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978696538"

It is assumed that the portfolio risk is measured by absolute standard deviation, and each investor has a risk tolerance on the investment portfolio. To complete the investment portfolio optimization problem, the issue is arranged into a linear programming model. Furthermore, determination of the optimum solution for linear programming is done by using a genetic algorithm. As a numerical illustration, we analyze some of the stocks traded on the capital market in Indonesia. Based on the analysis, it is shown that the portfolio optimization performed by genetic algorithm approach produces more optimal efficient portfolio, compared to the portfolio optimization performed by a linear programming algorithm approach.

The finished goods are considered as a set of multi-products and the aim of the proposed model is to optimise the product portfolio, production rate and supply rate simultaneously. In the proposed method, an advanced optimisation algorithm called ‘teaching–learning-based optimisation (TLBO) algorithm’ is applied for the product portfolio optimisation in a three-layer supply chain. Inspired by the teaching–learning process, the algorithm acts on basis of the effect of influence of a teacher on the output of learners in a class.

The most complex of these threats unfold in stages, as actors exploit multiple attack vectors in a sequence of calculated steps. Deciding how to respond to such serious threats poses a challenge that is of substantial practical relevance to IT security managers. These critical decisions require an understanding of the threat actors—including their various motivations, resources, capabilities, and points of access—as well as detailed knowledge about the complex interplay of attack vectors at their disposal. In practice, however, security decisions are often made in response to acute short-term requirements, which results in inefficient resource allocations and ineffective overall threat mitigation. The decision support methodology introduced in this paper addresses this issue. By anchoring IT security managers’ decisions in an operational model of the organization’s information infrastructure, we provide the means to develop a better understanding of security problems, improve situational awareness, and bridge the gap between strategic security investment and operational implementation decisions. To this end, we combine conceptual modeling of security knowledge with a simulation-based optimization that hardens a modeled infrastructure against simulated attacks, and provide a decision support component for selecting from efficient combinations of security controls. We describe the prototypical implementation of this approach, demonstrate how it can be applied, and discuss the results of an in-depth expert evaluation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and EURO - The Association of European Operational Research Societies.","Genetic algorithm; Interactive decision support; IT security analysis; Multi-objective portfolio selection; Simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048540894"

This technique suffers specific short-comings, for example, unstable convergence in the final solution, trapped in local optimum, and demand for high number of replications. Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) technique gives an efficient way to reach the global optimum by optimally assigning computing resource among designs. The integration of DE and OCBA gives better performance than DE alone in terms of convergence rate and the attained global optimum. The ordering of the integration also plays a vital role, that is, the strategy of first applying DE before OCBA outperforms the reversely ordered one. Both integration strategies are essentially the improved DE algorithms for large-scale portfolio optimization.

This paper presents a mixed integer non-linear optimization model for the weapon system portfolio problem. In order to solve this model, an adaptive immune genetic algorithm using crossover and mutation probabilities that are automatically tuned in each generation is proposed. A ground-based air defensive scenario is introduced to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. In addition, several large-scale instances that are produced by a test-case generator are also considered to demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm. Comparative experiments have shown that our algorithm outperforms its competitors in terms of convergence speed and solution quality, and it is competent for solving weapon system portfolio problems under different scales. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive immune genetic algorithm (AIGA); Integer non-linear optimization model; Test-case generator; Weapon system portfolio problem","Algorithms; Big data; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Military applications; Nonlinear programming; Adaptive immune genetic algorithms; Comparative experiments; Convergence speed; Crossover and mutation probabilities; Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization; Non-linear optimization; Test case generators; Weapon system; Optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978039721"

Recently this concept draws increasing attention from researchers, though most of the researches have concentrated on single objective optimization problems. This paper is intended to solve multiobjective optimization problems by proposing a multiple evolutionary algorithm portfolio. Differing from previous approaches, each component algorithm in our portfolio method has an independent population and the component algorithms do not communicate in any way with each other. Another difference is that our algorithm introduces no control parameters. This parameter-less characteristic is desirable as each additional parameter requires independent parameter tuning or control. A novel score calculation method, based on predicted performance, is used to assess the contributions of component algorithms during the optimization process. Such information is used by an algorithm selector which decides, for each generation, which algorithm to use. Experimental results show that our portfolio method outperforms individual algorithms in the portfolio. Moreover, it outperforms the AMALGAM method. © 2014 IEEE.","","Multiobjective optimization; Algorithm portfolios; Control parameters; Independent parameters; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization problem; Parameter-less; Predicted performance; Single objective optimization problems; Evolutionary algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908577745"

Based on optimization techniques, many algorithms have been proposed to mine different portfolios. In the previous approach, a group stock portfolio (GSP) was derived based on the investors' objective and subjective requests by the grouping genetic algorithm. Stocks were divided into groups, with those in the same group being similar. The benefit of using a GSP is that investors can replace any stock that they do not like with substitute stocks in the same group. To increase the similarity of stocks in groups, stock price series are taken into consideration, and an enhanced approach is proposed to derive a series-based GSP that can be used to provide more actionable stock portfolios to investors making decisions. In chromosome representation, grouping, stock and stock portfolio parts are used to represent a GSP as did the previous approach. To increase the return and similarity of a GSP, the stability factor is designed based on cash dividends, and the unit and price balances are utilized as well. Because the dimension of stock price series is high, the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) and extended symbolic aggregate approximation (ESAX) are selected to transform data points into symbols. Then, the series distance factor is presented to evaluate the similarity of stock price series in groups of a GSP. By using the new factors and the existing factors in the previous approach, two new fitness functions are developed to evaluate the quality of chromosomes. Experiments on a real-world dataset were conducted to show the merits of the proposed approach using the two fitness functions with SAX and ESAX. The results show that the return on investment (ROI) of the proposed approach using the fitness functions with SAX is approximately 16% to 18% and better than the ROI obtained with ESAX. However, the proposed approach with ESAX achieves better group similarity than does SAX. © 2017","Extended symbolic aggregate approximation; Group stock portfolio; Grouping genetic algorithm; Stock price series; Symbolic aggregate approximation","Aggregates; Approximation algorithms; Chromosomes; Costs; Economics; Electronic trading; Financial data processing; Function evaluation; Genetic algorithms; Health; Investments; Multivariable control systems; Optimization; Quality control; Extended symbolic aggregate approximation; Grouping genetic algorithms; Stock portfolio; Stock price; Symbolic aggregate approximation; Financial markets","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016203055"

Five different machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting, and stacking) are developed to classify the customers, and the best technique is selected using different performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Modern portfolio theory formulated it as a quadratic optimization problem of maximizing expected returns and minimizing the risk of the portfolio.

Relevant literature shows the success of evolutionary algorithms in modelling some of these preferences Multi-criteria algorithms for portfolio optimization under practical constraintsin a constrained optimization problem. This study proposes a candidate generation procedure and a repair mechanism for practical portfolio optimization model in multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) settings. Both these methods together can handle a larger class of constraints namely cardinality, pre-assignment, budget, quantity (floor and ceiling) and round-lot constraints. Proposed methods can easily be incorporated into existing evolutionary algorithms.

In order to eliminate oversimplifications of Markowitz' portfolio theory, we generalize the optimization framework to better emulate a more realistic investment environment.

The aim of this work is to be a useful instrument for helping finance practitioners and researchers with the portfolio selection problem. This study first reviews Modern Portfolio Theory's literature and describes the investment selection process. Second, this paper specifically aims at applying efficient optimization methods for solving the portfolio selection problem. Hence, the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches to resolve the portfolio selection problem with the objective of simultaneous risk minimization/return maximization are applied. Computational analyses are provided so as to investigate the performance of the algorithms and the input data. Therefore, at one step, four different portfolios are selected from Tehran Stock Exchange market, 50 top companies (Annual and monthly-based portfolios). Finally, this paper applies the selected portfolios to the stock market data of a 10-month period proceeding portfolios constructions. The results indicate that, the genetic annual-based portfolio has the best performance in contrast to its other counterparts; it outperforms the average return of market portfolio in a relatively short period. Moreover, PSO annual-based portfolio has a relatively good performance and could achieve the market portfolio's return during the test period. Findings show that using annual data is more efficient than the monthly data. On the whole, the results show that the evolutionary methods of this paper with annual data, can consistently handle the practical portfolio selection problem. © 2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT); Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Portfolio management","Commerce; Financial data processing; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Computational analysis; Evolutionary method; Input datas; One step; Optimization method; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection problems; Portfolio theories; Selection process; Short periods; Stock market; Tehran stock exchanges; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650288739"

This problem consists of selecting a number of assets from a market and their relative weights to form an investment strategy. These weights must be optimized against a utility function that considers the expected return of each asset, and their co-variance; which means that as the number of available assets increases, the search space increases exponentially. Our method introduces two new concepts that set it apart from previous evolutionary based approaches. The first is the Tree-based Genetic Algorithm (GA), a recursive representation for individuals which allows the genome to learn information regarding relationships between the assets, and the evaluation of intermediate nodes. The second is the hybridization with local search, which allows the system to fine-tune the weights of assets after the tree structure has been decided. These two innovations make our system superior than other representations used for multi-weight assignment of portfolios. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Memetic algorithm; Portfolio Optimization; Real-world application; Representation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67349105007"

The portfolio optimization problem is a typical bi-objective optimization problem with objectives the reward that should be maximized and the risk that should be minimized. While reward is commonly measured by the portfolio's expected return, various risk measures have been proposed that try to better reflect a portfolio's riskiness or to simplify the problem to be solved with exact optimization techniques efficiently. However, some risk measures generate additional complexities, since they are non-convex, non-differentiable functions. In addition, constraints imposed by the practitioners introduce further difficulties since they transform the search space into a non-convex region. The results show that MOEAs, in general, are efficient and reliable strategies for this kind of problems, and their performance is independent of the risk function used. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Multiobjective optimization; NSGA-II; PESA; Portfolio selection; SPEA2","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79959581550"

However, this model, contrary to its theoretical reputation, is scarcely used to construct a large-scale portfolio, due to its unrealistic assumption and tremendous computational complexity associated with solving a large-scale quadratic programming problem. In this paper, a mean-absolute deviation (L1 risk) portfolio optimization model with real feature is introduced. This model, a special case of the piecewise linear risk model, can remove most of the difficulties of Markowitz's model while maintaining its advantages. Furthermore, motivated by the compensatory property of EA and PSO, where the latter can enhance solutions generated from the evolutionary operations by exploiting their individual memory and social knowledge of the swarm, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The experimental results demonstrate the positive effect of this model, and reveal general design guidelines for future practice.","Evolutionary algorithm; Hybrid evolutionary algorithm; Mean-absolute deviation; Particle swarm optimization; Portfolio optimization","Evolutionary algorithms; Industrial engineering; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Piecewise linear techniques; Risk assessment; Evolutionary operations; Hybrid evolutionary algorithm; Markowitz's model; Mean-absolute deviation; Mean-absolute deviation portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Quadratic programming problems; Financial data processing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886884701"

Security's weights are represented by ""countries"" and manipulated for optimization. Its performance is evaluated using real market data. An ICA-based portfolio is selected from Tehran Stock market; thereafter, the portfolio is applied to the market for a six month period - the ""test period"". The results indicate the ICA-based portfolio has a better performance in contrast to the market portfolio. It outperforms the return of the market portfolio often during the test period. The approach is shown to be efficient; it can locate the solution in complicated/large search space of the real market with fast convergence speed, constant iteration number/time and never misses the optimal solution even when run repeatedly. The parameters of the proposed approach are calibrated throughout paper; the parameters that are consistent with the problem are reported.

All these constraints model different investor preferences and they are taken into account by portfolio managers in the real-world financial decision making.

Based on Chinese stocks by industries, we calculate the stocks' CSR measurements and perform model optimization by computing the efficient portfolios. Comparing with major indexes of Chinese stock markets as benchmarks by t-tests, some efficient portfolios outperform the indexes and therefore can justify our approach. Moreover, our methodology stems from established measurements of CSR and latest enrichments of programming methodology and finance and therefore can be applicable to CSR research worldwide.

Classical mean-variance portfolio selection aims at simultaneously maximizing the expected return of the portfolio and minimizing portfolio variance. In the case of linear constraints, the problem can be solved efficiently by parametric quadratic programming (i.e., variants of Markowitz' critical line algorithm). However, there are many real-world constraints that lead to a non-convex search space, e.g., cardinality constraints which limit the number of different assets in a portfolio, or minimum buy-in thresholds. As a consequence, the efficient approaches for the convex problem can no longer be applied, and new solutions are needed. In this paper, we propose to integrate an active set algorithm optimized for portfolio selection into a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The idea is to let the MOEA come up with some convex subsets of the set of all feasible portfolios, solve a critical line algorithm for each subset, and then merge the partial solutions to form the solution of the original non-convex problem. We show that the resulting envelope-based MOEA significantly outperforms existing MOEAs. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we introduce a resampling mechanism that deals with uncertainty in the parameters and results in efficient frontiers that are more robust.

Although a wide range of population-based algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimizers, and differential evolution, have been developed and studied under this scenario, the performance of an algorithm may vary significantly from problem to problem. This implies that there is an inherent risk associated with the selection of algorithms. We propose that, instead of choosing an existing algorithm and investing the entire time budget in it, it would be less risky to distribute the time among multiple different algorithms. A new approach named population-based algorithm portfolio (PAP), which takes multiple algorithms as its constituent algorithms, is proposed based upon this idea. PAP runs each constituent algorithm with a part of the given time budget and encourages interaction among the constituent algorithms with a migration scheme. As a general framework rather than a specific algorithm, PAP is easy to implement and can accommodate any existing population-based search algorithms. In addition, a metric is also proposed to compare the risks of any two algorithms on a problem set. We have comprehensively evaluated PAP via investigating 11 instantiations of it on 27 benchmark functions. Empirical results have shown that PAP outperforms its constituent algorithms in terms of solution quality, risk, and probability of finding the global optimum. Further analyses have revealed that the advantages of PAP are mostly credited to the synergy between constituent algorithms, which should complement each other either over a set of problems, or during different stages of an optimization process. © 2010 IEEE.","Algorithm portfolios; global optimization; metaheuristic algorithms; numerical optimization; population-based algorithms","Budget control; Global optimization; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Population statistics; Benchmark functions; Differential Evolution; Empirical results; Global optimum; Inherent risk; Meta heuristic algorithm; Migration scheme; Multiple algorithms; New approaches; Numerical optimizations; Optimization process; Particle swarm optimizers; Population-based algorithm; Search Algorithms; Solution quality; Time budget; Evolutionary algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957593400"

We use a variant of portfolio optimization technique to generate India's 12th five year plan electricity generation portfolio taking into account the carbon costs. For fitness evaluation of a generation portfolio, we use levelized generation costs and a Comprehensive Risk Barrier Index (CRBI), the latter capturing the cost risks modulated by project implementation barrier indices. For constrained optimization, we develop a fast hybrid algorithm, namely, Intelligent Pareto-search Genetic Algorithm (IPGA), which systematically evolves successively efficient frontiers and finally converges to the global Pareto-optimal front. This algorithm combines non-dominated sorting and separate elite population, while utilizing dual mode search for faster convergence and cluster reduction strategy for enhancing diversity. Halting mechanisms have been proposed for local and global Pareto convergence.

To remedy this gap, a multi-attribute asset quality analysis, before asset allocation, is proposed. Thus a two-stage multi-attribute portfolio selection framework that considers asset quality, as well as asset allocation, is formulated. For solving the proposed portfolio selection problem, this study applies genetic algorithms for multi-attribute portfolio selection and analysis. In the first stage, i.e. asset quality evaluation, a genetic algorithm is used to identify good quality assets in terms of asset ranking. In the asset allocation stage, allocation of capital to individual high-quality assets is optimized using another genetic algorithm based on Markowitz's mean-variance theory. Through the two-stage asset evaluation and allocation process, an optimal portfolio can be determined in the context of considering both multiple asset return attributes and risk exposures. Experimental results reveal that the proposed multi-attribute portfolio selection framework provides a very feasible and useful tool to assist investors in planning their investment strategy and constructing their portfolios. © 2009 INFOR Journal.","Asset allocation; Asset quality evaluation; Genetic algorithm; Mean-variance model; Multi-attribute portfolio selection","Genetic algorithms; Investments; Optimization; Risk management; Strategic planning; Asset allocation; Asset quality evaluation; Mean variance model; Multi-attributes; Portfolio selection; Quality evaluation; Quality control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-73649106950"

To avoid daily recalculations of proportion of capital invested in portfolio assets, we introduce a novel set of weight parameters based on proportion of shares. Optimal portfolio allocation in the VaR context is computationally very complex since VaR is not a coherent risk metric while number of local optima increases exponentially with the number of securities.

The results show ACO performs better than PSO in the case of small-scale and large-scale portfolio, but in the case of medium-scale portfolio, PSO performs a better than ACO technique. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Portfolio Optimization (PO); Sharpe Ratio (SR); Swarm Intelligence (SI)","Algorithms; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Financial data processing; Multiobjective optimization; ACO algorithms; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Ant-colony optimization; Markowitz; Mean variance; Multi-objective optimization problem; New technologies; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; PSO algorithms; Social insects; Swarm intelligence; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954636447"

The uncharacteristic behaviour associated with the problem enhances the computational efforts required to obtain a feasible and near-optimal solution. This paper proposes an algorithm portfolio methodology based on evolutionary algorithms, which takes into account the stochastic nature of customer demand to solve this computationally complex problem. These problems are well known to have computationally complex objective functions, which make their solutions hard to find, particularly when problem instances of large dimensions are considered. Of particular importance in such situations is the timeliness of the solution. For example, Apple was forced to delay their shipments of iPads internationally due to unprecedented demand and issues with their delivery systems in Samsung Electronics and Seiko Epson. Such examples illustrate the importance of stochastic customer demands and the timing of delivery. Moreover, most of the evolutionary algorithms, known for providing computationally efficient solutions, are unable to always provide optimal or near optimal solutions to all the VRPSD instances within allocated time interval. This is due to the characteristic variations in the computational time taken by evolutionary algorithms for same or varying size of the VRPSD instances. Therefore, this paper presents portfolios of different evolutionary algorithms to reduce the computational time taken to resolve the VRPSD. Moreover, an innovative concept of the mobility allowance (MA) in landmoves based on the levy's distribution function has been introduced to cope with real situations existing in vehicle routing problems. The proposed portfolio approach has been evaluated for the varying instances of the VRPSD. Four of the existing metaheuristics including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artificial Immune System (AIS), TABU Search (TS) along with new neighbourhood search, are incorporated in the portfolios. Experiments have been performed on varying dimensions of the VRPSD instances to validate the different properties of the algorithm portfolio. An illustrative example is presented to show that the set of metaheuristics allocated to certain number of processors (i.e. algorithm portfolio) performed better than their individual metaheuristics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This assumption is not correct and hence the method leads to poor portfolio optimization performance. Hence an alternative but efficient method is proposed in which the mean and variance of expected return are first predicted with a low complexity functional link artificial neural network model (FLANN). The predicted values of mean and variance are consequently used in multi objective swarm intelligence techniques for achieving better performance. The multi objective swarm intelligence techniques chosen are non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA - II) and multi objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO).The performance of the proposed prediction based portfolio optimization model has been compared with the Markowitz mean-variance model. The comparison of the performance includes three performance metrics, Pareto front and nonparametric statistical test using the Sign test. On examining the performance metrics it is observed that the proposed prediction based portfolio optimization model approach provided improved Pareto solutions but maintaining adequate diversity. © 2012 Newswood Limited.

But, almost none of these studies deals with genetic relation algorithm (GRA), where GRA is one of the evolutionary methods with graph structure. This study presents an approach to large-scale portfolio optimization problems using GRA with a new operator, called guided mutation. In order to pick up the most efficient portfolio, GRA considers the correlation coefficient between stock brands as strength, which indicates the relation between nodes in each individual of GRA. Guided mutation generates offspring according to the average value of correlation coefficients in each individual, which means to enhance the exploitation ability of evolution of GRA. A genetic relation algorithm with guided mutation (GRA/G) for the portfolio optimization is proposed in this paper. Genetic network programming (GNP), which was proposed in our previous research, is used to validate the performance of the portfolio generated with GRA/G. The results show that GRA/G approach is successful in portfolio optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to a lack of information as regards the economy and in finance, problems with uncertainties (stock prices, marketing problems, inflation, unemployment) are usually formulated by giving bounds on maximum and minimum values of certain parameters, i.e. box constraints. In such situations, it is necessary to make a choice of better parameters that produce finite intervals of possible values for a given uncertain function at each point of the parameter space. The gamma algorithm presents a method for making that choice. A variant of the gamma algorithm based on the cubic algorithm is considered, for global optimization of uncertain functions with box constraints in Rn. The set-monotonic algorithm contains a block for problems with equality constraints, and operates within the unit cube [0, 1]n for all problems.

Furthermore, we measure differences between VaR efficient frontiers and variance efficient frontiers in VaR-return space and we evaluate out-sample capacity of portfolios on both bullish and bearish markets. The results indicate the reliability of VaR-efficient portfolios on both bullish and bearish markets and a significant improvement over Markowitz efficient portfolios in the VaR-return space.

The most important characteristic within this optimization problem is the risk and the returns. Modern portfolio theory provides a well-developed paradigm to form a portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of risk tolerance. Multi objective portfolio optimization problem is the portfolio selection process that result highest expected return and smallest identified risk among the various financial assets. In this paper, we propose to identify expected return (mean profit) and risk using historical data of stock prices. The downside values of the variance of each stock are considered to be the identified risk in first case. The Value at Risk of each stock that we obtained using parametric and historical simulation methodology are considered to be the identified risk in second case. One of method being widely used lately for optimization need is Genetic Algorithm or GA. This method adapted the mechanism of biology mechanism involving natural selection. With many advantages it has, numerical process of a portfolio optimization in both case are attempted to be coupled with Genetic Algorithm. The values of expected return and risk of each stock will be used as inputs into a fitness function in Genetic Algorithm. Performance evaluation is done by examining the parameters of GA, such as population size, stall generation and number of elitism. ©2010 IEEE.","Expected return; Fitness function; Genetic algorithm; Multi objective portfolio optimization; Risk","Biology; Financial data processing; Function evaluation; Health; Optimization; Population statistics; Profitability; Expected return; Financial assets; Fitness function; Fitness functions; Historical data; Historical simulation; Multi objective; Multi-objective portfolio optimization; Natural selection; Numerical process; Optimization problems; Performance evaluation; Population sizes; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Portfolio theories; Research fields; Risk tolerance; Stock portfolio; Stock price; Value at Risk; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952616100"

This approach takes place in two steps: The first step is to classify the actions of this portfolio into classes, known as under portfolios, with the expected returns and VaR's close to each other by using the K-Means method, then we apply an algorithm dynamic optimization called Min-VaRMaxVaL to the portfolio that has the highest expected return and the lowest average VaR obtained by this classification. The algorithm proposed MinVaRMaxVaL for the selection of optimal actions portfolio is based on genetic algorithms and Value at Risk (VaR). The objective of our algorithm is to minimize risk and maximize portfolio value at the same time through two stages. The first step is to minimize the risk measured by the value at risk (VaR) for a given value of portfolio. While the second step, a dynamically maximizes the value of portfolio as the result is greater than the portfolio value set at the first stage and the risk resulting from the second stage is lower than that obtained from the first.

This problem belongs to the class of stochastic control problems with singular controls, which are usually solved by computing solutions to related partial differential equations called the free-boundary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The dimensionality of the HJB equals the number of stocks in the portfolio. The runtime of existing solution methods grow super-exponentially with dimension, making them unsuitable to compute optimal solutions to portfolio optimization problems with even four stocks. In this work we first present a boundary update procedure that converts the free boundary problem into a sequence of fixed boundary problems. Then by combining simulation with the boundary update procedure, we provide a computational scheme whose runtime, as shown by the numerical tests, scales polynomially in dimension. The results are compared and corroborated against existing methods that scale super-exponentially in dimension.

These are transaction costs, minimum transaction units and limits on minimum holdings. The model is a mixed integer linear model which generalizes one of the linear models which recently appeared in the literature as an alternative to the classical Markowitz model. Unfortunately, in order to obtain a greater realism in the problem modelling a set of binary and integer variables needs to be introduced. Computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the complexity of the model, which is applied to the Milan stock market. The results show that the presence of the integer variables dramatically increases the computational complexity of the model compared with the continuous version. For this reason we analyze a heuristic solution procedure based on two phases, which reflect the investor's empirical approach to the problem. The computational results show that the heuristic procedure generates an error lower than 4.1 % and that the error decreases when the capital invested increases.

The innovations embedded in the system enable users to confidently design effective plans for achieving financial goals, employing accurate analysis based on real data. Traditional analysis and prediction methods are based on mean variance analysis - an approach known to be faulty. The new software system takes a much more sophisticated and strategic direction. State-of-the-art technology integrates simulation and metaheuristic optimization techniques and a new surface methodology based on linear programming into a global system that guides a series of evaluations to reveal truly optimal investment scenarios. In this paper we will present new techniques that increase the flexibility of optimization tools and deepen the types of portfolio analysis that can be carried out.

This results in a substantially higher-dimensional problem than the original n-dimensional one, namely (2K+1)n-dimensional optimization problem with (4K+1)n additional constraints, where 2K is the number of different transaction costs functions. The higher-dimensional problem is computationally expensive to solve. This two-part paper presents a method for solving the (2K+1)n-dimensional problem by solving a sequence of n-dimensional optimization problems, which account for the transaction costs implicitly rather than explicitly. The key idea of the new method in Part 1 is to formulate the optimality conditions for the higher-dimensional problem and enforce them by solving a sequence of lower-dimensional problems under the nondegeneracy assumption. In Part 2, we propose a degeneracy resolving rule, address the efficiency of the new method and present the computational results comparing our method with the interior-point optimizer of Mosek. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Convex programming; Portfolio optimization; Variable transaction costs","Computation theory; Costs; Financial data processing; Problem solving; Condition; Expected utility; High-dimensional problems; Higher-dimensional problems; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Time-periods; Transaction cost; Utility functions; Variable transaction cost; Convex optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36148952936"

We present a method for solving the 3n-dimensional problem by solving a sequence of n-dimensional optimization problems, which accounts for the transaction costs implicitly rather than explicitly. The method is based on deriving the optimality conditions for the higher-dimensional problem solely in terms of lower-dimensional quantities. The new method is compared to the barrier method implemented in Cplex in a series of numerical experiments. With small but positive transaction costs, the barrier method and the new method solve problems in roughly the same amount of execution time. As the size of the transaction cost increases, the new method outperforms the barrier method by a larger and larger factor. © 2005 INFORMS.","Convex programming; Portfolio optimization; Transaction costs","Costs; Linear programming; Numerical methods; Optimization; Problem solving; Three dimensional; Convex programming; Portfolio optimization; Transaction costs; Algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-27744523602"

A higher moments Bayesian portfolio optimization model can overcome the shortcomings of the traditional Markowitz approach and take into consideration the skewness of asset returns and parameter uncertainty. This paper presents a comparison between the simulated annealing and the nonlinear programming methods of optimization for the Bayesian portfolio selection problem in which the objective function includes the portfolio mean, variance and skewness. We make the comparison for a utility function that is easily optimized using both methods. In particular we maximize a cubic utility function, and our results show that to achieve the same level of accuracy, the CPU time for the nonlinear programming optimization will be shorter than for the simulated annealing algorithm.

Mathematical search and optimization algorithms can greatly simplify the planning process. A particularly well suited class of algorithms for oil and gas optimizations are Genetic Algorithms. This paper will discuss the application of Genetic Algorithms in oil and gas portfolio optimization. We will show that Genetic Algorithm's are excellent at handling accurate and complex,non-linear business models. This class of algorithms is capable of scaling upwards of a thousand projects, well beyond the reach of traditional methods. Genetic Algorithm's are capable of generating multiple 'good' solutions, providing an opportunity to explore alternative characteristics of the portfolios including value and risk measures. A portfolio analyst can request to keep non-viable solutions that best satisfy the business constraints. This will be shown with a hypothetical, yet realistic set of oil and gas projects, which will be modeled and analyzed on a personal computer.","","Finance; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Optimization; Strategic planning; Financial planner; Oil and gas industry; Portfolio analysis theory; Petroleum industry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034515413"

The collection of exploration projects comprises the opportunity set for the portfolio. In the decision tree approach, selecting a few scenarios from the full distribution and assigning probabilities to those scenarios approximates the range of possible project outcomes. In contrast to the decision tree method, stochastic simulation proceeds by assigning probability distributions to key input variables. In a single iteration of the simulation each of these variables is randomly sampled, with allowances for dependencies, in order to calculate cash flow and economic parameters such as net present value. This process is repeated many times for each exploration project to produce a distribution of economic outcomes. Earlier studies have shown the difficulty of adequately characterizing projects with large uncertainty using the decision tree approach. In this paper we take the comparison between decision tree and simulation methodologies to the next stage by looking at the effect on portfolio selection of the differing evaluation methodologies. The portfolio analysis is carried out using the optimization methodology pioneered by Markowitz to estimate the combination of projects, which produces the maximum NPV for a given level of risk. Comparison of the project selections made for the decision tree and stochastic simulation portfolios shows significant differences between the project selections required to produce an efficient portfolio for the two different evaluation methodologies. This result implies that, even if a decision tree model could be constructed which adequately characterized the uncertainty in a project, the optimization of a collection of projects modelled using decision trees may not yield an efficient portfolio if the full range of uncertainty were to be considered.","","Computer simulation; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Investments; Iterative methods; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Probability distributions; Project management; Random processes; Risk assessment; Trees (mathematics); Capital allocation; Economic evaluation; Petroleum prospecting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1142279453"
