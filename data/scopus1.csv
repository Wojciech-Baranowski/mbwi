However, the influence of the available controls is often poorly understood, and methods for evaluating the effects of these controls are necessary to tune quantum computational performance. Here we use portfolio optimization as a case study by which to benchmark quantum annealing controls and their relative effects on computational accuracy. We compare empirical results from the D-Wave 2000QTM quantum annealer to the computational ground truth for a variety of portfolio optimization instances. We evaluate both forward and reverse annealing methods and we identify control variations that yield optimal performance in terms of probability of success and probability of chain breaks. © 2021 authors.

By backtesting classical and quantum computing algorithms, we can get a sense of how these algorithms might perform in the real world. This work establishes a methodology for backtesting classical and quantum algorithms in equivalent conditions, and uses it to explore four quantum and three classical computing algorithms for portfolio optimization and compares the results. Running 10 000 experiments on equivalent conditions we find that quantum can match or slightly outperform classical results, showing a better escalability trend. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic backtesting comparison of classical and quantum portfolio optimization algorithms. In this work, we also analyze in more detail the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem, running on simulators and real quantum computers from IBM. The benefits and drawbacks of backtesting are discussed, as well as some of the challenges involved in using real quantum computers of more than 100 qubits. Results show quantum algorithms can be competitive with classical ones, with the advantage of being able to handle a large number of assets in a reasonable time on a future larger quantum computer.  © 2020 IEEE.","Backtesting; conditional value at risk variational quantum eigensolver (CVaR VQE); portfolio optimization; quantum computing (QC); variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)","Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Market Research; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Backtesting; Computational modelling; CVaR VQE; Market researches; Optimisations; Portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; VQE; Optimization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179037821"

The most important and common problems are combinatorial optimization problems in finance, such as common stock investment, financial management, etc. Among such problems, linear system solving problems are of this type. The core of the problem. Now with the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, it has been well applied in the financial industry, but with the advent of the era of big data, massive amounts of data have brought huge challenges to the solution of classic solving methods and computing resources. Lloyd et al. proposed an HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Under some assumptions, this algorithm can solve linear equations with exponential acceleration compared to classical algorithms. It is a key step in current quantum machine learning algorithms. More classic algorithms can achieve exponential acceleration. In this paper, the use of HHL algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems in finance has been researched and tested. The problem is described as a quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the corresponding program design is carried out, verified and the final system state is carried out. The results are measured, and the results are analyzed. It is found that compared with the classical solution method, the HHL algorithm can be used to solve such combinatorial optimization problems, and the approximate solution obtained is in good agreement with the exact solution, which can be applied well. The solution process of such combinatorial optimization problems can be accelerated, and quantum computing can be better applied to such problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","HHL; Portfolio optimization; Quadratic programming; Quantum machine learning","Combinatorial optimization; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Linear systems; Support vector machines; Combinatorial optimization problems; Exponentials; Financial managements; Financial problems; HHL; Machine-learning; Mathematical problems; Portfolio optimization; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quadratic programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135047041"

The Sharpe ratio is a common assessment strategy. However, the Sharpe ratio considers an uptrend portfolio high risk because it assesses portfolio risk using standard deviations. Hence, we propose a novel investment strategy, namely, the trend ratio, to assess portfolio risk more accurately by the portfolio trend line. Thus, the uptrend portfolio is not considered high risk and is more consistent with the psychology of investors. In addition to normal trading (long selling), short selling is another common trading method. Short selling is borrowing stocks from stock vendors to sell and then repaying the stock at a lower price to make a profit. This paper proposes investing simultaneously in normal trading and short selling by a trend ratio, which can further increase investment profits and spread risks. This paper also adds certificates of deposit as a portfolio choice to ensure that investors can still make profits. This paper utilizes the global quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm with a quantum NOT-gate (GNQTS) to effectively find the best combination of stocks. To avoid the overfitting problem, this paper employs a sliding window. Specifically, this paper combines the trend ratio, GNQTS, short selling with certificates of deposit, and sliding windows to perform the stock selection. The experimental results are promising, with our proposed method having better performance than the Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the experimental results show that both long selling and short selling investments can increase the performance.  © 2021 IEEE.","Metaheuristics; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratio; Short selling; Sliding window; Stock selection; Trend ratio","Commerce; Decoding; Deposits; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Risk assessment; Sales; Tabu search; Metaheuristic; Performance; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio risks; Quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm; Sharpe ratios; Short selling; Sliding Window; Stock selections; Trend ratio; Profitability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120325031"

Some advanced research in recent years has proposed the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the DPO problem, which demonstrated to be more advantageous than supervised learning in solving the DPO problem. However, there are still certain unsolved issues: 1) DRL algorithms usually have the problems of slow learning speed and high sample complexity, which is especially problematic when dealing with complex financial data. 2) researchers use DRL simply for the purpose of obtaining high returns, but pay little attention to the problem of risk control and trading strategy, which will affect the stability of model returns. In order to address these issues, in this study we revamped the intrinsic structure of the model based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and proposed the Augmented DDPG model. Besides, we also proposed an innovative risk control strategy based on Quantum Price Levels (QPLs) derived from Quantum Finance Theory (QFT).

People tend to invest in the stock market and expect a stable uptrend portfolio to spread the investment risk effectively. As global economies affect each other, investing in global markets is the best way to address systematic risk for effective financial management. Selecting an appropriate portfolio across global markets involves a substantial solution space; thus, an efficient and effective evolutionary computation is proposed. The novel entanglement-enhanced quantum-inspired optimization technique is proposed as an efficient mechanism to search for the relationship between stocks with high-dependency solutions. The novel indicator trend ratio aims to evaluate the investor-desired portfolio with a stable uptrend under a perfect balance between return and risk. Therefore, this study is the first attempt to evaluate the major global markets in the Group of Seven (G7) countries to expand the generality of trend ratio usage. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed novel approach has better and more precise searchability than other state-of-the-art optimization. The proposed intelligent model outperforms the Sharpe ratio, benchmark strategy, and index performance regarding the trend ratio, risk, maximum drawdown, and profit factor. The results reveal that risk dispersion substantially improves investment performance. Under the evaluation of the trend ratio, the proposed system integrates G7 markets as an expansion of a prospective avenue for global asset management © 2023 IEEE.","Global market; Local search; Portfolio selection; Quantum-inspired optimization; Trend ratio","Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; International trade; Investments; Local search (optimization); Quantum entanglement; A-stable; Financial managements; Global market; Local search; Management IS; Optimisations; Portfolio optimization models; Portfolio selection; Quantum-inspired optimization; Trend ratio; Financial markets","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173600405"

This problem is central to quantitative finance. After a detailed introduction to the problem, we implement a number of quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms on different hardware platforms to solve its discrete formulation using real data from daily prices over 8 years of 52 assets, and do a detailed comparison of the obtained Sharpe ratios, profits, and computing times. In particular, we implement classical solvers (Gekko, exhaustive), D-wave hybrid quantum annealing, two different approaches based on variational quantum eigensolvers on IBM-Q (one of them brand-new and tailored to the problem), and for the first time in this context also a quantum-inspired optimizer based on tensor networks. In order to fit the data into each specific hardware platform, we also consider doing a preprocessing based on clustering of assets. From our comparison, we conclude that D-wave hybrid and tensor networks are able to handle the largest systems, where we do calculations up to 1272 fully-connected qubits for demonstrative purposes. Finally, we also discuss how to mathematically implement other possible real-life constraints, as well as several ideas to further improve the performance of the studied methods. ©American Physical Society","","Costs; Financial data processing; Investments; Computing time; Discrete formulations; Dynamic portfolios; Hardware platform; Investments portfolios; Portfolio optimization; Quantum processors; Real data sets; Sharpe ratios; Transaction cost; Tensors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122849165"

Quantum-inspired optimization (QIO) algorithms simulate quantum mechanisms to achieve quantum advantages using classical computers. QIO algorithms can serve as a bridge to realizing preliminary quantum advantages by exploiting classical computation abilities. In a detailed analysis of PO, a domain-dependent optimization technique is proposed combined with an effective QIO, called the entanglement local search-assisted (ELSA) technique. ELSA introduces the novel concept of the entangled neighborhood for PO and assists QIO in accurately searching a potential area, thus significantly promoting the quality of the solution. The entanglement relationship can decrease the degree of freedom searched. The proposed ELSA-QIO technique is employed in a trend ratio-based intelligent system to search for a steady uptrend portfolio in the global G20 markets. This study discusses the expanded markets to demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed QIO method in a vast solution space. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We combine a classical preprocessing step with a modified unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and evaluate it using simulated annealing (classical computer), digital annealing (Fujitsu’s Digital Annealing Unit), and quantum annealing (D-Wave Advantage). Starting from Markowitz’s theory on portfolio optimization, our classical preprocessing step finds the most promising assets within a set of possible assets to choose from. We then modify existing QUBO models for portfolio optimization, such that there are no limitations on the number of assets that can be invested in. Furthermore, our QUBO model enables an investor to also place an arbitrary amount of money into each asset. We apply this modified QUBO to the set of promising asset candidates we generated previously via classical preprocessing. A solution to our QUBO model contains information about what percentage of the whole available capital should be invested into which asset. For the evaluation, we have used publicly available real-world data sets of stocks of the New York Stock Exchange as well as common ETFs. Finally, we have compared the respective annealing results with randomly generated portfolios by using the return, variance, and diversification of the created portfolios as measures. The results show that our QUBO formulation is capable of creating well-diversified portfolios that respect certain criteria given by an investor, such as maximizing return, minimizing risk, or sticking to a certain budget. © 2022 by the authors.","digital annealing; portfolio optimization; quantum annealing; QUBO; simulated annealing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143687843"

Classical formulations of this quadratic optimization problem have exact or heuristic solutions, but the complexity scales up as the market dimension increases. Recently, researchers are evaluating the possibility of facing the complexity scaling issue by employing quantum computing. In this paper, the problem is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which in principle is very efficient. The main outcome of this work consists of the definition of the best hyperparameters to set, in order to perform Portfolio Optimization by VQE on real quantum computers. In particular, a quite general formulation of the constrained quadratic problem is considered, which is translated into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization by the binary encoding of variables and by including constraints in the objective function. This is converted into a set of quantum operators (Ising Hamiltonian), whose minimum eigenvalue is found by VQE and corresponds to the optimal solution. In this work, different hyperparameters of the procedure are analyzed, including different ansatzes and optimization methods by means of experiments on both simulators and real quantum computers. Experiments show that there is a strong dependence of solutions quality on the sufficiently sized quantum computer and correct hyperparameters, and with the best choices, the quantum algorithm run on real quantum devices reaches solutions very close to the exact one, with a strong convergence rate towards the classical solution, even without error-mitigation techniques.

In this paper, a novel quantum optimization model was applied to interval analysis method for multi-stage investment portfolio. Firstly, the multi-period investment portfolio selection models are designed by using inequalities equations of interval coefficients. Secondly, to solve the multi-stage investment portfolio constraint, the quantum mechanics is used along with an adaptive strategy designed to determine the best particle`s positions for a better global position.

A recent construction developed in 2021 has sparked the field of financial portfolio optimization through the Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA). In this study, we investigated the complexity and efficiency of quantum optimization algorithms with a special interest in QWOA. The objective is to minimize investment risk by having a good combination of assets in the portfolio. We also focused on reducing the number of iterations while attaining a high-quality resolution through contraction of the solution space to ease computations. The concept of QWOA was extended by constructing a newly outperforming scheme known as the “Quantum Mix Optimization Algorithm (QMOA).” QMOA algorithm codes were provided for the implementation and simulation of numerical results. In addition, the efficiency of QMOA, which is better than the existing QCO algorithms, was discussed. For instance, the least QWOA number of computations required to execute the initial state equation was p > 2, whereas this value was p ≥ 2 in the proposed QMOA. © 2023 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.","Combinatorial optimization; Induced tadpole graph; Lattice; Qubits; Trajectory","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166639318"

We provide a complete quantum circuit-level description of the algorithm from problem input to problem output, making several improvements to the implementation of the QIPM. We report the number of logical qubits and the quantity and/or depth of non-Clifford T gates needed to run the algorithm, including constant factors. The resource counts we find depend on instance-specific parameters, such as the condition number of certain linear systems within the problem. To determine the size of these parameters, we perform numerical simulations of small PO instances, which lead to concrete resource estimates for the PO use case. Our numerical results do not probe large enough instance sizes to make conclusive statements about the asymptotic scaling of the algorithm. However, already at small instance sizes, our analysis suggests that, due primarily to large constant prefactors, poorly conditioned linear systems, and a fundamental reliance on costly quantum state tomography, fundamental improvements to the QIPM are required for it to lead to practical quantum advantage.  © 2023 authors.

The portfolios are influenced by the risk factors in the market and it is important to select optimal portfolios that can maximize the returns with minimum risk values. Other than the risk factor, there are several other influential factors that reduce the optimality of the portfolios. Therefore, by considering all possible constraints, this study proposes a multi-constraint MPO model that selects the optimal portfolio based on the asset returns. To solve the multi-constrained problem, a novel quantum-inspired whale optimization algorithm (QWOA) is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm enhances the traditional optimization model to work in a multi-constrained scenario. Here, quantum entanglement is adapted to reduce the slow convergence issue of whale optimization. Apart from considering only the risk factors, this paper also considers certain higher-order moments (HOM), such as skewness, kurtosis, transaction cost, diversification, boundary and budget constraints. These factors affect the portfolios as the market is dynamic, and timely changes are always seen. Thus, optimizing the mentioned factors aids in attaining an optimal portfolio. Empirical evaluations are performed, and the results suggested that the proposed model provided beneficial outcomes as compared with other algorithms like whale optimization algorithm (WOA), gray wolf optimization (GWO), fruitfly optimization algorithm (FOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and fruitfly algorithm (FA). The overall net return rate of the proposed model is always above 0.85% for different values of upper bounds, and the obtained Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, STARR ratio, information ratio, Shannon entropy, and downside deviation values of the proposed algorithm are 5.016254, 0.89327, − 0.01987, 0.103826, 3.04452 and 0.2854. Hence, the proposed approach is highly effective for optimizing the constrained MPO. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Higher-order constraints; Market risks; Multi-period portfolio optimization; Net return rate; Quantum entanglement; Quantum whale optimization","Budget control; Commerce; Constrained optimization; Costs; Higher order statistics; Investments; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); High-order; High-order constraint; Higher-order; Market risks; Multi-period; Multi-period portfolio optimization; Net return; Net return rate; Optimisations; Ordering constraints; Portfolio optimization; Quantum whale optimization; Quantum entanglement","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186175591"

In our approach, we are initiating the foremost step towards addressing the above milestone by performing a comparative study between quantum optimization techniques (available on both gate-model as well as quantum annealers) versus classical by solving a finance domain problem, that is, portfolio optimization using Markowitz mean-variance optimization. Historical market data from Jan'2011 till Dec'2016 of 48 NSE stocks were considered to build the portfolio by optimizing the mean-variance based on Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory. We approach this first classically and then on gate-model based quantum computer using Qiskit SDK, followed by D-wave solvers to build efficient portfolio and compare which among these frameworks are mature enough in this NISQ era to solve portfolio optimization problem related to the finance domain. Our results are comparable and from our experimentation performed on D-wave annealers and gate-model simulators, we observed that implementations using quantum methods were faster than the corresponding implementation of classical methods.  © 2022 IEEE.","Comparative study Quantum vs Classical; Gate-model based quantum computing; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; Quantum annealing; Quantum Portfolio optimization","Computation theory; Financial markets; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Quantum theory; Binary optimization; Comparative study quantum vs classical; Comparatives studies; Gate models; Gate-model based quantum computing; Model-based OPC; Portfolio optimization; Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Quantum portfolio optimization; Quantum computers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149170044"
