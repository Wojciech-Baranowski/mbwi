Some advanced research in recent years has proposed the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the DPO problem, which demonstrated to be more advantageous than supervised learning in solving the DPO problem. However, there are still certain unsolved issues: 1) DRL algorithms usually have the problems of slow learning speed and high sample complexity, which is especially problematic when dealing with complex financial data. 2) researchers use DRL simply for the purpose of obtaining high returns, but pay little attention to the problem of risk control and trading strategy, which will affect the stability of model returns. In order to address these issues, in this study we revamped the intrinsic structure of the model based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and proposed the Augmented DDPG model. Besides, we also proposed an innovative risk control strategy based on Quantum Price Levels (QPLs) derived from Quantum Finance Theory (QFT). Our experimental results revealed that our model has better profitability as well as risk control ability with less sample complexity in the DPO problem compared to the baseline models.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191785","Beijing Normal University(grant numbers:R202008); Hong Kong Baptist University; Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:UICR0400050-21CTL); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191785","Dynamic Portfolio Optimization;Portfolio Management;Deep Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Quantum Finance Theory;Quantum Price Levels","Deep learning;Profitability;Supervised learning;Quantum mechanics;Finance;Reinforcement learning;Stability analysis","","","","28","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As it is difficult for users to observe a large amount of stock data, this system helps investors to deal with portfolio optimization issues and further provides an information visualization interface to analyze more investment situations. The user interface of the proposed system provides a new service for users to get started quickly in stock selection and clearly analyze the performance of portfolios in the different stock markets. The proposed method can also push notifications automatically when the system detects that the trend of the user’s portfolio is going to slow down, and reminds them to invest in new portfolios with a strong uptrend in a timely manner. The system also designs three games. The first two games make people familiar with stocks. The third game combines social computing with gameplay, which helps to simultaneously find a better portfolio in the highly complex data.

However, the Quantum Computing paradigm is inherently capable of solving such types of problems. One of the major milestones inclined to a quantum -ready era is a relative comparison of execution speed and overall efficiency of current classical versus quantum models. In our approach, we are initiating the foremost step towards addressing the above milestone by performing a comparative study between quantum optimization techniques (available on both gate-model as well as quantum annealers) versus classical by solving a finance domain problem, that is, portfolio optimization using Markowitz mean-variance optimization. Historical market data from Jan’2011 till Dec’2016 of 48 NSE stocks were considered to build the portfolio by optimizing the mean-variance based on Harry Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory. We approach this first classically and then on gate-model based quantum computer using Qiskit SDK, followed by D-wave solvers to build efficient portfolio and compare which among these frameworks are mature enough in this NISQ era to solve portfolio optimization problem related to the finance domain. Our results are comparable and from our experimentation performed on D-wave annealers and gate-model simulators, we observed that implementations using quantum methods were faster than the corresponding implementation of classical methods.","","978-1-6654-5361-5","10.1109/TQCEBT54229.2022.10041475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041475","Quantum Portfolio optimization;Comparative study Quantum vs Classical;Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization;Quantum annealing;Gate-model based quantum computing","Computers;Annealing;Computational modeling;Finance;Simulated annealing;Logic gates;Quantum annealing","","","","26","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Sharpe ratio is a common assessment strategy. However, the Sharpe ratio considers an uptrend portfolio high risk because it assesses portfolio risk using standard deviations. Hence, we propose a novel investment strategy, namely, the trend ratio, to assess portfolio risk more accurately by the portfolio trend line. Thus, the uptrend portfolio is not considered high risk and is more consistent with the psychology of investors. In addition to normal trading (long selling), short selling is another common trading method. Short selling is borrowing stocks from stock vendors to sell and then repaying the stock at a lower price to make a profit. This paper proposes investing simultaneously in normal trading and short selling by a trend ratio, which can further increase investment profits and spread risks. This paper also adds certificates of deposit as a portfolio choice to ensure that investors can still make profits. This paper utilizes the global quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm with a quantum NOT-gate (GNQTS) to effectively find the best combination of stocks. To avoid the overfitting problem, this paper employs a sliding window. Specifically, this paper combines the trend ratio, GNQTS, short selling with certificates of deposit, and sliding windows to perform the stock selection. The experimental results are promising, with our proposed method having better performance than the Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the experimental results show that both long selling and short selling investments can increase the performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126652","National Taiwan University (NTU); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 108-2638-E-002-002-MY2,109-2222-E-005-002-MY3,109-2221-E-260-014,109-2627-M002-003,110-2221-E-260-014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606934","Stock selection;portfolio optimization;trend ratio;short selling;sharpe ratio;sliding window;metaheuristics","Portfolios;Market research;Investment;Stock markets;Security;Hidden Markov models;Timing","","8","","65","CCBY","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work establishes a methodology for backtesting classical and quantum algorithms in equivalent conditions, and uses it to explore four quantum and three classical computing algorithms for portfolio optimization and compares the results. Running 10 000 experiments on equivalent conditions we find that quantum can match or slightly outperform classical results, showing a better escalability trend. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic backtesting comparison of classical and quantum portfolio optimization algorithms. In this work, we also analyze in more detail the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem, running on simulators and real quantum computers from IBM. The benefits and drawbacks of backtesting are discussed, as well as some of the challenges involved in using real quantum computers of more than 100 qubits.

Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.","","979-8-3503-0961-4","10.1109/ICEACE60673.2023.10441858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10441858","Quantum computing;Credit scoring;Computational model;QUBO model","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Credit cards;Quantum annealing;Risk management;Optimization;Portfolios","","","","7","IEEE","28 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People tend to invest in the stock market and expect a stable uptrend portfolio to spread the investment risk effectively. As global economies affect each other, investing in global markets is the best way to address systematic risk for effective financial management. Selecting an appropriate portfolio across global markets involves a substantial solution space; thus, an efficient and effective evolutionary computation is proposed. The novel entanglement-enhanced quantum-inspired optimization technique is proposed as an efficient mechanism to search for the relationship between stocks with high-dependency solutions. The novel indicator trend ratio aims to evaluate the investor-desired portfolio with a stable uptrend under a perfect balance between return and risk. Therefore, this study is the first attempt to evaluate the major global markets in the Group of Seven (G7) countries to expand the generality of trend ratio usage.
